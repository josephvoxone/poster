When it's destiny, love will manifest you.
Be patient, love is alchemizing.
Clear the path, love waits for goodbyes.
Dear priestess, your cup shall hold an ocean, as big as your heart.
Dear priestess, God prayed you into the world.
Dear priestess, love is the chakra between us.
Love doesn't need you to be ready, it requires you to be open.
My heart doesn't stop beating for you, I can feel your drums at 3 am.
Love wants what it has, goodbyes are required.
You are the heart, born from a wish made by the stars to be seen again by love.
Let yourself out of the cage, you were born for the wild.
Your heart is a magnet, it's how the universe finds you, trust what comes, let go of what doesn't.
Co-creation is sexy, my love language is planting seeds.
Only love knows who you are, only love can see you, be love and you'll know why.
She will love again, love will teach you how to be patient.
Some people will only love you when you're gone, true love happens before you even meet.
How come love never gave us a chance? We tripped over something we always wanted.
Dear love, I want to be on your mind while I'm sleeping.
'I love you' felt like a weapon in battle, 'it's not you' felt like the anchor.
Loose cannons never made it out of the bedroom.
And we're replaced by scars that held our stars, I feel it snowing inside me.
If this moment is all we have, then why water it down? Isn't the sunflower in the rain enough, or is it that all you feel is thunder?
I don't want to know where we're going, I want to know you.
Love is our vessel, I can feel your aura calling.
I promise I'll let go of happiness soon, I forgot about the other ways I could love you.
I promise I won't go anywhere. I know... I can't stay either. Goodbye again, until my thoughts of you tomorrow. Hello again?
Promises are dissolving in my woes, must I be a delicacy everywhere I go? Devour me in peace.
So what if they run away, love is specifically made like a coffee. You are an acquired taste, my favorite cup.
You can't put love in a box, we didn't find God that way.
Please let love into your heart, unless you want it to stop breathing.
I don't want ride or die love, love doesn't need you to crash and burn.
Stop pushing me away, just let me go if you don't want me to stay.
Watering down your words is why you don't know anymore.
I float in what's meant to be will be, goodbye always sinks to the bottom.
Stop and smell the roses, it's different every time, just like you, always.
I can't let go of holding on to you, I love you doesn't believe in death.
Fire gives ice a reason, fear is who I may become without you. I need you.
Love promises to sweep the road, will you take it? Get out of your own way.
You don't have to protect love, love is there to protect you, tell them the truth.
Why do I feel sad about falling for you? It hurts to cut the stem off a dying rose.
Forgive my heart strings, they don't know any better, come back in five years.
I think you'll know when I look at you, how to say 'I love you' for the first time.
I thought I was whole then I met you, parts of me feel like all of me now.
Thank you for loving my future self, the sun sets beyond this mountain.
Love me like a helix, I promise I'll come back to life.
Look at me through the mirror, karma gave your heart back.
Kiss my aura, these sacred lips are sealed.
Dear universe, who am I? You are every piece you're willing to share, just like LOVE.
I'm letting go and trusting the universe, wherever I land, kiss me for good.
I beg you not to fall in love with my wings, love takes us where we can heal goodbyes.
Love weaves stars into wrinkles and scars, these tattoos tell a story worthy of your tears.
There are days I'm deep in the mud and days I can't stop craving it, I'm not numb anymore, I'm terrified.
Just tell me, who are you? I am what doesn't have to wait for you.
We can't see what we're not willing to be, yet our hearts never stop bleeding.
Connections are not accidents, get out of your own way. How many nights must I awaken you?
Will you live without telling time? Love has birthdays even when you're broken.
I am worthy of love, I'm just picking up all my pieces, BRB.
I am a bridge, don't walk all over me. I can take you wherever you want to go.
A kite has nowhere to go, but it doesn't need anywhere else to be. You are the tide that comes from every droplet of "I love you."
You are the tide that comes from every droplet of "I love you." I miss you still love.
"I love you" changes every world, just say it. I LOVE YOU.
First love teaches us how to forget time.
Forget time, forever is right now, together in bliss. Sincerely yours, Love.
Love comes back to teach us how on again/off again isn't what forever really means.
The last and final love comes with every love before it. True love time travels.
Once you say "fuck it," love says "fuck it." Love teaches us how to stop looking for it.
They say you'll know when you meet the one, but do you know yourself? Until we know, love teaches us who we are.
If time becomes the reason you are still together or the reason for the next milestone, love has already moved on.
Once we realize that love needs to rest in order to last, it guides us to build a foundation between two pillars. Two hearts beating in rhythm.
Forever is a long time without love, but one day in love is worth a lifetime. Take your time healing, love knows when you're ready.
One day, love will choose you. You are worthy of love.
I see a warrior in a uniform that wasn't meant for her.
I see a wall up between her and her inheritance.
I see how she asked the wolves to guard her heart.
I see how she took her time in hiding, to see how long she could hold her breath.
She never wanted to die, she chose the path her heart trusted most.
To claim her kingdom now because she was ready and her heart knew how.
You don't have to dance when you live in the flow of the rhythm. This is the song written for her by the universe.
Dear God, it's us against the world. No, it's us beside the world.
You don't need proof. Let the walls fall, it's not your fault.
Do not deny yourself from an entire world I made for you. Love.
Dear God, can you even hear me? How can I when you don't know who you are? I am as loud as your thoughts.
Oh, my aging heart, this life is heavy. I didn't know what beautiful was, unfinished.
Will love ever be allowed to make love to you again? I don't need your cape to fall in love with you.
I want you naked and raw. Sexy is the crevices outlining your soul.
Where did that gun to your head come from? It's time to let go.
Threads of the universe tangled in your mind. The roads were never meant to burn.
Dear time, when did you become the gate to my heart? The world keeps asking you how old you are.
Let the chips fall and the new roses bloom. There is room for all of you.
Sometimes love knows more than us, that's what hurts the most.
Give yourself a chance, the universe already loves you as you are. I love you.
What we need now isn't what we needed anymore.
It feels like I lost myself looking for the new me somewhere out there, anywhere.
It's as if everything changed, except me. When will I ever be ready?
The truth is we may never be ready. Every glass feels like swallowing an ocean.
Growing can feel like there's not enough room for every old me and now what feels new.
How do I leap into the life I want when it feels so far away? Stop trying to jump and take one honest step.
Every truth lives inside you and you know it, but so does fear, shame, and anger. Learn to say goodbye inside first.
If it isn't love anymore, you're just learning how to say goodbye.
Your kingdom doesn't need a king, my Queen. But who you choose will turn the soil.
She snuck God in with a kiss.
A lion sleeps at her feet. She's tired of running.
She asked for my intentions. I gave her the ocean I'm swimming in.
Love visits in my dreams and wakes my heart with the sun.
Where the f*ck is home? You're not meant to build what's already yours.
I can see all of you. Thank you, God.
I crave you the way I miss home. This kingdom was always yours.
How do I surf on what scares me? There is love in the water.
Fate didn't ask for my permission; it whispered, "Do you remember me again?" Love time travels in our story.
But my, have the gardens missed you, a thorn for every year the roses aren't picked. I promised you I'd wait.
Dear love, I'm sorry I took so long. Will you wait for me to fall first this time?
Sometimes so many wounds want to say hello.
Why the f*ck am I here? Knocks on my door, and I don't know who's going to answer.
It hurts to smile sometimes; I just can't change the past, no matter how many times I time travel.
The truth is I died a long time ago; all that is left is the God within my soul.
I sit back wondering how the oceans were made by all the sufferings, and nobody ever mentions how long we wait.
But this is an ode to the living; I see your sufferings that break your heart open.
I promise you these cries will turn into laughs once more.
And what is gone shall say goodbye no more.
School never taught me about the wounds; life did.
Wounds are passed down by the mother and father when they aren't done healing; the energy is very real but unseen.
how a child receives the energy before the lessons, questioning why am I like this? — these triggers take us down the rabbit hole...
how they were never rose-colored glasses, just the kind no one can help you take off, but you. — when you don't know, trust that it's divine.
how they can make you feel so alone, painting the villains in your garden. — I see you when you cannot see yourself.
guarded, wounds teach you how to build walls — until the hurricanes fail you.
and you reach the end of a road, somehow it's always a cliff. — do I jump to fall or will I fly?
you go back and build new armor, this time there's a mission involved. — will I slay these dragons?
you're not saving the world just yet, you are saving you. — the world will wait, I promise.
I'm lighting candles for our NSFW ceremony.
taking turns on our knees, praying.
I want to taste sacred with you.
I wish I could go with you to find me.
I saved these 'I got you' eyes for you. maybe this time you can find me, — my divinity game is headstrong. YO, where you at? — stay still, drop a pin, I'll come to you.
I Was Never Broken: Volume 3 You taught me— infatuation is a phase chemistry can burn out connections can fade You taught me — love can be platonic love can be demonic love can be euphoric You taught me — everything is disposable forever isn't forever who we once were isn't
love is worth every second it lives.
we invented love lifetimes ago, — an anomaly made for the two of us.
Goodbye wounds, — I still feel the strings how they quiver.
learning to love myself so I think I can forgive you if I let this go but I know will never forgive myself if I don't let go
it took me a long time to get here I don't want to lose myself again

THE JOURNEY TO FINDING THE
ROOT CAUSE OF SUFFERING

"People have a hard time letting go of their suffering.
Out of a fear of the unknown, they prefer suffering
that is familiar.” — Thich Nhat Hanh

Ae is an important distinction to make when speak-
ing about suffering. When I mention suffering in this
book, I'm referring to psychological and emotional suffer-

ing. There is a way in which, no matter what happens in

yout life, you do not have to suffer €motionally and psycho-

complex can always be broken down into its smaller coun-
terparts. The truth cannot be broken down into smaller
constituents, which is what makes it truth. This is why truth
is always simple. If you want to find the truth, look for sim-
plicity.

Approach this book with an open mind and a heart of
pure intention to know the truth and you'll receive every-
thing you've been searching for.

Before we move on, I want to take a moment to express
my deepest gratitude for you being here and sharing your
time and attention with me. Those are some of the most val-
uable life forces you could give to another, so thank you for
that gift to me, which you are also giving to your self. Never
forget your own divinity because it is only through our di-

vinity that we have our humanity.

With Love & Light,

Thoughts create. Thinking destroys.

The reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we
begin to think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting
beliefs, judgements, criticisms, programming, and condi-
tioning onto the thought, thinking of infinite reasons as to
why we can’t do it and why we can’t have it.

Without thinking, we prevent all negative program-
ming and judgements from tarnishing the initial thought of
what you want to create.

If] asked you what are some ways you could make the
amount of money you want, if you sat there long enough,
you'll experience the same phenomenon of having random

thoughts pop into your head of ways you could make it hap-
pen.

that do not align with your
wellbeing, growth, and serenity
—without the guilt, shame, or fear
of being misunderstood.

“One who looks around him is intelligent, one who looks

within him is wise.” — Matshona Dhliwayo

W: live in a world of thought, not reality. Sydney
Banks once said, “Thought is not reality; yet it is

through thought that our realities are created.” Each of us
lives through our own perceptions of the world, which are
vastly different from the person right next to us. An exam-
ple of this is that you could be sitting in a coffee shop having
a quarter-life existential crisis, completely stressed out of
your mind about how you have no idea what you're doing
with your life when it seems like everyone else has theirs to-
gether, while the person next to you is happily enjoying
their freshly brewed drink while peacefully people watch-
ing. You both are in the same exact coffee shop, smelling

fulfilled. Your soul is the reason why you’re even on this
journey in the first place — to find peace, love, and joy for
yourself.

Your mind has done an amazing job at what it was
made to do, but now you may relieve it of its job because we
no longer live in the wild where death could be right around
the corner in a bush. If we keep using our minds, we will
constantly stay in a state of fight or flight, anxiety, fear,
frustration, depression, anger, resentment, and all negative
emotions because the mind thinks everything is a threat to
our very existence. If you want to be free, happy, peaceful,
and full of love, then you will need to let go of listening only
to your mind and go beyond it by tuning into something
much greater that will help you not just to survive, but to

thrive.


===== 2023-05-29_13-49-51_UTC_3.jpg =====
If we want to see the natural state of anything, one of
the best ways is to look at nature and the state of it in its
infancy (before it is affected by its environment).

For example, let's look at the natural state of a baby.
What is a baby's natural state (assuming the baby wasn't
abused, neglected, or had any physical issues) ? Are babies
naturally stressed, anxious, fearful, self-conscious, or
worrying about their safety? Or are they naturally in a state
of bliss, happiness, and love?

Our natural state of being is joy, love, and peace.

Therefore, any thinking that we do will only take us away

from those natural states of being, which is why whenever

we feel extremely stressed, we are having a LOT of thinking
going on. The strength of the negative emotion we feel is in
direct proportion to how much thinking we are d oing in the
moment.

On the other hand, the intensity oftha nw...

HeTC TS ee
a about suffering. When I mention suffering in this

book, I'm referring to psychological and emotional suffer.

ing. There is a way i
your life, you do not have to suffer emotionally and psycho-

n which, no matter what happens in

logically.
I am not saying that what we go through is all in our

heads or made up. Terrible and unfortunate events happen
to people every single day. What I'm saying is that although
we experience a lot of pain in our lives, suffering is optional.
In other words, pain is unavoidable, but how we react to the
events and circumstances that happen in our lives is up to

us, and that will dictate whether we suffer or not.

“You never stop loving. Once you love
someone honestly, truly, you will never
be able to un-love them. You only find
someone you will love more. At that
time, your old love will not feel so
strong, but it is a heart, it will never let
you forget something that ever made
you happy." Mar 15, 2016

She isn’t the easiest girl to love.


===== 2023-06-06_01-24-31_UTC_2.jpg =====
She has this bad habit of overthinking,
she tends to overreact more than she
should, and she gets a little insecure
every once in a while.


===== 2023-06-06_01-24-31_UTC_3.jpg =====
She isn’t capable of fully trusting you,
she doesn’t know when to stop fighting

has no problem pushing you away if she
feels like you’re close to hurt her.

She'll be needy for your attention, she’ll
want to literally take up all of your time,
and she'll require a lot of reassurance.

Loving her means you get to see her at
her worst and most vulnerable and that
is something that you'll have to be strong
enough to handle because she needs
someone who’s patient enough to
understand why she is who she is today.
It’s not gonna be an easy relationship

your everything. It's a team effort

to him. Why not give him
three days and make him
realize it is serious and he’s
really losing you?”

girl. She deserves so so much more
than the world. She's such an angel.

me want to try my best to deal with my

BLOOMING Bap

si Let Them Lose You

You need to let people lose you
et them go along with the crowd
Let them believe what they want to believe

Let them think they have better
Let them sleep on your worth

Because in due time

they will realize the mistake they made,

and it will be just enough time for you

to accept that you’re better off without them.

If you’ve hurt me in any way, just know that I have NO intent to

THOUGHTS VS. THINKING

SELLE AIO

> — Lao Tzu

houghts are the energetic, mental raw materials from
pee we use to create everything in the world. We
can’t experience anything without thought. It’s important
to know that thoughts are a noun and aren’t something that
we do, but something we have. A thought takes no effort or
force on our end, and it is something that just happens. We

also cannot control what thoughts pop into our minds. The

external reasons of why you would want to do something,
so it focuses your answer on what you truly want to create
(usually its for no reason other than you just wanting to
create it because it's fun), without any influences from the
material world.

Try asking the question and seeing what comes up for
you! You'll be surprised at what surfaces, but don't get

caught up with your thinking when those true dreams of

yours begin to be revealed to you.

Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and
that is how our perception of reality is created. This is how
our experience of life is created from the inside out.

It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but
our interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or
bad about something. This is how people in third world
countries can be happier than people in first world coun-
tries and people in first world countries can be more miser-

able than people in third world countries. .

Therefore, we
can only ever feel what we are thinking.

Let's hypothetically say that you really hate your job,
and it causes you an enormous amount of stress, anxiety,
and frustration. It pains you to even set foot in the building
where you work and just thinking about your job makes
you furious. When you're thinking about your job, you're
just sitting there on a sofa with your family watching a TV
show together, but you are fuming at the thought of your

job. Everyone else is having a good time, except you.


===== 2023-07-21_15-00-49_UTC_4.jpg =====
iT you dont overthink it and truly let the answers sur-
face from within you, without that thought, you will most
likely feel and be happy, peaceful, free, and light.

Without our usual thinking about a particular event or
thing, our experience of it completely alters. This is how we
live in a world of thought, not reality, and how our percep-
tion of reality is created from the inside out, through our
own thinking. With this new understanding, you ve just un-
covered the cause of all our human psychological suffer-

ing...

The root cause of our suffering is ou:

Now before you throw this book across the room and
light it on fire, I'm not saying that this is all in our heads and
that it isn't real. Our perception of reality is very real. We
will feel what we think, and our feelings are real. That is
completely undeniable. However, our thinking will look
like an inevitable, unchangeable reality to us until we begin
seeing how our reality is created. If we know that we can
only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we

A Young Monk & the Empty Boat (A Zen Story About
How Thinking is the Cause of Our Own Suffering)

A long time ago, a young Zen monk was living in a
small monastery that was located in a forest which was near
a small lake. The monastery was occupied by a few senior
monks while the rest were newcomers and still had much
to learn. The monks had many obligations in the monas-

tery, but one of the most important ones
was their dai

routine where they had to sit down, close their e

On a piano, there are 88 keys. When we look at a pi-

ano, we don't point out specific keys for no reason and say
that that key is "wrong". We only think a specific key is
"wrong", if we think someone is playing a specific song and
hits a key that isn't in the song.

If you dont overthink it and truly let the answers sur-
face from within you, without that thought, you will most
likely feel and be happy, peaceful, free, and Light.

Without our usual thinking about a particular event or
thing, our experience of it completely alters. This is how we
live in a world of thought, not reality, and how our percep-
tion of reality is created from the inside out, through our
own thinking. With this new understanding, you've just un-
covered the cause of all our human psychological suffer-

ing...

Now before you throw this book across the room and

light it on fire, I'm not saying that this is all in our heads and
that it isn't real. Our perception of reality is very real. We
will feel what we think, and our feelings are real. That is
completely undeniable. However, our thinking will look
like an inevitable, unchangeable reality to us until we begin
seeing how our reality is created. If we know that we can
only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we

can change our feria by changing our thinking. Thus, w

Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and
that is how our perception of reality is created. This is how
our experience of life is created from the inside out.

It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but
our interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or
bad about something. This is how people in third world
countries can be happier than people in first world coun-
tries and people in first world countries can be more miser-

able than people in third world countries. |

its. Therefore, we
can only ever feel what we are thinking.

Let's hypothetically say that you really hate your job,
and it causes you an enormous amount of stress, anxiety,
and frustration. It pains you to even set foot in the building
where you work and just thinking about your job makes
you furious. When you're thinking about your job, you're
just sitting there on a sofa with your family watching a TV
show together, but you are fuming at the thought of your

job. Everyone else is having a good time, except you.

I do not have the time, energy, or desire to be anyone’s enemy,
If you’ve hurt me in any way, just know that I have NO intent to
hurt you back. I will not attack your character, tell lies about
you, or worse—tell the truth, I will simply carry on and allow
you to do the same, knowing that God will handle you in His

Loving her means you get to see her at

THOUGHTS VS. THINKING

La we use to create everything in the world. We
can’t experience anything without thought. It’s important
to know that thoughts are a noun and aren’t something that
we do, but something we have. A thought takes no effort or
force on our end, and it is something that just happens. We
also cannot control what thoughts pop into our minds. The

Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and
that is how our perception of reality is created. This is how
our experience of life is created from the inside out.

It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but
our interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or
bad about something. This is how people in third world
countries can be happier than people in first world coun-

Let's hypothetically say that you really hate your job,
