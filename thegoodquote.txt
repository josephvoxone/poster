Anxiety & depression is being scared

Say "hi" first. If there's anything I've
learned, it's that if you want to talk to
someone - talk to them. Go out on a limb.
Do not wait for them to talk to you first
because odds are they're waiting for the
same thing.

always be in the same place.

===== 2022-12-10_01-00-08_UTC_1.jpg =====
Anxiety fucking sucks. You unintentionally
make yourself sad, you feel alone even
when you're not and sometimes you
don't even know what's wrong.


===== 2022-12-10_01-00-08_UTC_2.jpg =====
Understand this, you can sound confi-
dent and have anxiety. You can look
healthy but feel like shit. You can look
happy and be miserable. So be kind,
because every person is fighting a
battle you know nothing about.


===== 2022-12-10_01-00-08_UTC_3.jpg =====
Having anxiety and depression is like
being scared and tired at the same time.
It's the fear of failure but no urge to be
productive. It's wanting friends but hate
socialising. It's wanting to be alone but
not wanting to be lonely. It's caring about
everything then caring about nothing. It's
feeling everything at once then feeling
paralysingly numb.


===== 2022-12-10_01-00-08_UTC_4.jpg =====
| don't think people understand how
stressful it is to explain what's going

People look for you in their lives
everyday, whether you realize it or not. It
could be a friend, it could be someone
you pass on the street regularly, and
maybe it's the bus driver who knows to
wait when they see you running down the
road towards them again.


===== 2022-12-11_07-00-08_UTC_4.jpg =====
Thinking about that specific type of
intimacy from being in someone's
bedroom for the first time and you're
poking around their items and they're
reclined backwards on their bed telling
you all the little stories while they follow
you around the room with their eyes and
you feel it.


===== 2022-12-11_07-00-08_UTC_5.jpg =====
Hearing people say "I can see you doing
that" after telling them what you want to
do in life is honestly one of the best

You’re not too sensitive. You’re not
overreacting. If it hurts you, it hurts
you.


===== 2023-01-07_18-00-09_UTC_2.jpg =====
Never be ashamed of how much you love,

it. Don't ever be sorry for loving the way
your heart knows.

===== 2023-01-08_18-00-08_UTC_1.jpg =====
Understand this, you can sound confi-
dent and have anxiety. You can look
healthy but feel like shit. You can look
happy and be miserable. So be kind,
because every person is fighting a
battle you know nothing about.


===== 2023-01-08_18-00-08_UTC_2.jpg =====
Anxiety fucking sucks. You unintentionally
make yourself sad, you feel alone even
when you're not and sometimes you
don't even know what's wrong.


===== 2023-01-08_18-00-08_UTC_3.jpg =====
Having anxiety and depression is like
being scared and tired at the same time.
It's the fear of failure but no urge to be
productive. It's wanting friends but hate
socialising. It's wanting to be alone but
not wanting to be lonely. It's caring about
everything then caring about nothing. It's
feeling everything at once then feeling
paralysingly numb.

===== 2023-01-10_18-00-09_UTC_1.jpg =====
The reality is none of us are easy to be
with. We all suffer from something. So
when you meet someone who’s willing to
stay committed to understanding you and
actually wants to grow with you. Don’t let
lame stuff like ego and pride ruin it.


===== 2023-01-10_18-00-09_UTC_2.jpg =====
Don't miss out on something that could
be great just because it could also be
difficult.


===== 2023-01-10_18-00-09_UTC_3.jpg =====
A person in two months can make you
feel what a person in two years couldn’t.
Time means nothing, character does.


===== 2023-01-10_18-00-09_UTC_4.jpg =====
No one wants to hear this, but truth be
told...a longlasting relationship comes
with a lot of forgiveness and
understanding. You have to accept the
fact that your partner isn’t perfect and will
hurt you, disappoint you, upset you.


===== 2023-01-10_18-00-09_UTC_5.jpg =====
A relationship isn’t always 50/50. Some
days your person will struggle. You suck
it up and pick up that 80/20 because they
need you. That’s love.


===== 2023-01-10_18-00-09_UTC_6.jpg =====
We often want it so badly that we
ruin it before it begins. Overthinking,
fantasizing, imagining, expecting,
worrying, doubting. Just let it
naturally evolve.

===== 2023-01-13_19-00-03_UTC_1.jpg =====
I've been thinking a lot lately about taking
chances, and how it's really just about
overcoming fear. Because the truth is,
everytime you take a big risk in your life,
no matter how it ends, you're always glad
you took it.


===== 2023-01-13_19-00-03_UTC_2.jpg =====
It's risky. It's scary. It could all fall apart,
yes. But what if it all falls together?


===== 2023-01-13_19-00-03_UTC_3.jpg =====
Take chances, take a lot of them.
Because honestly, no matter where you
end up and with whon,, it always ends up
the way it should be. Your mistakes make
you who you are. You learn and grow
with each choice you make. Everything is
worth it. Say how you feel, always. Be
you, and be okay with it.


===== 2023-01-13_19-00-03_UTC_4.jpg =====
Stop thinking so hard about everything.
Stop overanalyzing. Just go. Just do. If it
feels right, go with the flow. If it feels
wrong, don't think about it anymore and
walk away.


===== 2023-01-13_19-00-03_UTC_5.jpg =====
You're right, it might not work out. Most
things don't. But that doesn't mean you
shouldn't try. Because if it does, your
entire world can change.

many tough days that you tought you

===== 2023-02-21_19-00-10_UTC_1.jpg =====
Having anxiety and depression is like
being scared and tired at the same time.
It's the fear of failure but no urge to be
productive. It's wanting friends but hate
socialising. It's wanting to be alone but
not wanting to be lonely. It's caring about
everything then caring about nothing. It's
feeling everything at once then feeling
paralysingly numb.


===== 2023-02-21_19-00-10_UTC_2.jpg =====
Anxiety fucking sucks. You unintentionally
make yourself sad, you feel alone even
when you're not and sometimes you
don't even know what's wrong.


===== 2023-02-21_19-00-10_UTC_3.jpg =====
Understand this, you can sound confi-
dent and have anxiety. You can look
healthy but feel like shit. You can look
happy and be miserable. So be kind,
because every person is fighting a
battle you know nothing about.


===== 2023-02-21_19-00-10_UTC_4.jpg =====
| don't think people understand how
stressful it is to explain what's going
on in your head when you don't even
understand it yourself.

===== 2023-02-24_19-00-05_UTC_1.jpg =====
The reality is none of us are easy to be
with. We all suffer from something. So
when you meet someone who’s willing to
stay committed to understanding you and
actually wants to grow with you. Don’t let
lame stuff like ego and pride ruin it.


===== 2023-02-24_19-00-05_UTC_2.jpg =====
Don't miss out on something that could
be great just because it could also be
difficult.


===== 2023-02-24_19-00-05_UTC_3.jpg =====
A person in two months can make you
feel what a person in two years couldn’t.
Time means nothing, character does.


===== 2023-02-24_19-00-05_UTC_4.jpg =====
No one wants to hear this, but truth be
told...a longlasting relationship comes
with a lot of forgiveness and
understanding. You have to accept the
fact that your partner isn’t perfect and will
hurt you, disappoint you, upset you.


===== 2023-02-24_19-00-05_UTC_5.jpg =====
A relationship isn’t always 50/50. Some
days your person will struggle. You suck
it up and pick up that 80/20 because they
need you. That’s love.


===== 2023-02-24_19-00-05_UTC_6.jpg =====
We often want it so badly that we
ruin it before it begins. Overthinking,
fantasizing, imagining, expecting,
worrying, doubting. Just let it
naturally evolve.

===== 2023-02-26_19-00-07_UTC_1.jpg =====
I've been thinking a lot lately about taking
chances, and how it's really just about
overcoming fear. Because the truth is,
everytime you take a big risk in your life,
no matter how it ends, you're always glad
you took it.


===== 2023-02-26_19-00-07_UTC_2.jpg =====
It's risky. It's scary. It could all fall apart,
yes. But what if it all falls together?


===== 2023-02-26_19-00-07_UTC_3.jpg =====
Take chances, take a lot of them.
Because honestly, no matter where you
end up and with whon,, it always ends up
the way it should be. Your mistakes make
you who you are. You learn and grow
with each choice you make. Everything is
worth it. Say how you feel, always. Be
you, and be okay with it.


===== 2023-02-26_19-00-07_UTC_4.jpg =====
Stop thinking so hard about everything.
Stop overanalyzing. Just go. Just do. If it
feels right, go with the flow. If it feels
wrong, don't think about it anymore and
walk away.


===== 2023-02-26_19-00-07_UTC_5.jpg =====
You're right, it might not work out. Most
things don't. But that doesn't mean you
shouldn't try. Because if it does, your
entire world can change.

===== 2023-04-08_18-00-10_UTC_1.jpg =====
Anxiety fucking sucks. You unintentionally
make yourself sad, you feel alone even
when you're not and sometimes you
don't even know what's wrong.


===== 2023-04-08_18-00-10_UTC_2.jpg =====
Having anxiety and depression is like
being scared and tired at the same time.
It's the fear of failure but no urge to be
productive. It's wanting friends but hate
socialising. It's wanting to be alone but
not wanting to be lonely. It's caring about
everything then caring about nothing. It's
feeling everything at once then feeling
paralysingly numb.


===== 2023-04-08_18-00-10_UTC_3.jpg =====
Understand this, you can sound confi-
dent and have anxiety. You can look
healthy but feel like shit. You can look
happy and be miserable. So be kind,
because every person is fighting a
battle you know nothing about.


===== 2023-04-08_18-00-10_UTC_4.jpg =====
| don't think people understand how
stressful it is to explain what's going
on in your head when you don't even
understand it yourself.

===== 2023-04-10_18-00-09_UTC_1.jpg =====
The reality is none of us are easy to be
with. We all suffer from something. So
when you meet someone who’s willing to
stay committed to understanding you and
actually wants to grow with you. Don’t let
lame stuff like ego and pride ruin it.


===== 2023-04-10_18-00-09_UTC_2.jpg =====
Don't miss out on something that could
be great just because it could also be
difficult.


===== 2023-04-10_18-00-09_UTC_3.jpg =====
A person in two months can make you
feel what a person in two years couldn’t.
Time means nothing, character does.


===== 2023-04-10_18-00-09_UTC_4.jpg =====
No one wants to hear this, but truth be
told...a longlasting relationship comes
with a lot of forgiveness and
understanding. You have to accept the
fact that your partner isn’t perfect and will
hurt you, disappoint you, upset you.


===== 2023-04-10_18-00-09_UTC_5.jpg =====
A relationship isn’t always 50/50. Some
days your person will struggle. You suck
it up and pick up that 80/20 because they
need you. That’s love.


===== 2023-04-10_18-00-09_UTC_6.jpg =====
We often want it so badly that we
ruin it before it begins. Overthinking,
fantasizing, imagining, expecting,
worrying, doubting. Just let it
naturally evolve.

===== 2023-04-12_18-00-10_UTC_1.jpg =====
Take chances, take a lot of them.
Because honestly, no matter where you
end up and with whon,, it always ends up
the way it should be. Your mistakes make
you who you are. You learn and grow
with each choice you make. Everything is
worth it. Say how you feel, always. Be
you, and be okay with it.


===== 2023-04-12_18-00-10_UTC_2.jpg =====
I've been thinking a lot lately about taking
chances, and how it's really just about
overcoming fear. Because the truth is,
everytime you take a big risk in your life,
no matter how it ends, you're always glad
you took it.


===== 2023-04-12_18-00-10_UTC_3.jpg =====
It's risky. It's scary. It could all fall apart,
yes. But what if it all falls together?


===== 2023-04-12_18-00-10_UTC_4.jpg =====
Stop thinking so hard about everything.
Stop overanalyzing. Just go. Just do. If it
feels right, go with the flow. If it feels
wrong, don't think about it anymore and
walk away.


===== 2023-04-12_18-00-10_UTC_5.jpg =====
You're right, it might not work out. Most
things don't. But that doesn't mean you
shouldn't try. Because if it does, your
entire world can change.

Some people never go above
and beyond for their partner
but because they don't cheat,
they think they're God's gift.

In my opinion, staying faithful
in a relationship is the bare
minimum. I'm tired of people
using loyalty alone, to stress
how much of a catch they
are.

THE FORGOTTEN LOVE LANGUAGE @ 7

Sixteen years in a relationship opened my eyes
to a hidden love language that people rarely talk
about.

It's late 2010, barely a year into our relationship.
My wife just failed the most important exam of
her life. We take long walks, followed by even
longer phone calls, but nothing works. She
retreats deeper into her shell. It hurts to see a
partner suffer, especially when there is nothing
you can do about it.

I’m not Christian, and at this time in our
relationship, I’d never been to my wife’s church.
In fact, | hadn’t been inside any church for
awhile, but | knew the importance of her faith,
especially at such a crucial moment.

Against my preference, | told her that we were
going the church that Sunday. Irrespective of
the long trek from my house in North London to
Old Kent Road, | promised that we would go the
service that week.

No miracles happened during the service, but
gradually after a few weeks, my wife emerged
for the cocoon that threatened to swallow her
confidence, and thrived. When she got her first
graduate job, but something else happened
aswell. It marked our first (of many) victory as a
couple. We were no longer individuals, cheering
each other on from the sidelines, we became a
team. That’s where | stumbled across the
hidden love language. The ‘trials of
companionship’.

The ‘trials of companionship’ is a language
spoken in all meaningful relationships.
Obstacles either pull you apart or pull you
together. It’s hard to survive the storm without a
navigator; you don’t take off down the runway
without a crew. A couple with a purpose bonds
together.

We all know the basic five love languages.
Tumblr has them memorized like Taylor Swift
tour dates, and you can find them all over social
media: Words of affirmation, Quality time,
Receiving gifts, Acts of service, and Physical
touch. These practices are essential for
individual happiness in a marriage, but does
individual happiness mean mutual happiness?

Relationships crumble because of myself, my
own, and me. Me, me, me. The current trend is
to put ‘me’ before ‘we.’ Couples tell me ‘so and
so doesn’t make me happy’ or ‘they don’t think
about ‘me.’ | can tell you this for free, whether
it’s Mother, Father, Sibling, Best Friend, Long
Lost Friend, Partner, Lover, or even a surprise
Beyoncé album release; it’s dangerous to make
another person responsible for your happiness.

Stop saying it’s okay if it’s
not okay. Don’t silence the
parts of you that still feel
discomfort. Don’t suppress
your emotions that are a
result of their actions for the
sake of keeping the peace.
If you are still bothered,
there is no peace. That’s a
form of self-neglect.

you do things

you don’t want to

out of loneliness

their warm body

is never enough

to chase the cold away
lying beside them

feels lonely

and when they kiss you
goodbye

the sentiment

is always empty

but you repeat the cycle
knowing damn well
these interactions

will never settle

the sadness in your soul
I'm not judging you

I just want you to know
that you are not alone

I see you
