"THESE 6 THINGS
(THE SECRET FORMULA)

(swipe left)


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_10.jpg =====
My friend Paul makes $50k/month
on YouTube without showing his

face or recording his own videos.

Follow him to learn how
it works.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_2.jpg =====
1. HARD WORK

Don't believe in luck, believe in
hard work. Stop trying to rush the
process or searching fora
shortcut. There is none.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_3.jpg =====
2. PATIENCE

If you are losing the patience, you
are losing the battle. First nothing
happens, then it happens slowly
and suddenly all at once. Most
people give up at stage one.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_4.jpg =====
3. SACRIFICE

If you don't sacrifice for what you
want, then what you want becomes
the sacrifice. Everything has its price.
The question is: Are you ready to pay
it for the life you desire?


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_5.jpg =====
4. CONSISTENCY

Consistency is what transforms
average info excellence. Without
consistency, you will never achieve
greater success.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_6.jpg =====
5. DISCIPLINE

Motivation gets you going, but
discipline keeps you growing. There
will be days when you don't feel like
doing it. You have to push through
those days regardless of how you feel.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_7.jpg =====
6. SELF - CONFIDENCE

Confidence is, I'll be fine if they don’t
like me. There will always be someone
judging you for who you are and what
you want from life.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_8.jpg =====
Most people want to build
an online business and be
successful...

The problem? They don’t
know What to do, or who to

And most frustrating of all,
they don’t even know how
to start.

Here’s the trap you need
to avoid >


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_9.jpg =====
Don’t try to start it all alone.

It may take you 10 years
alone or 1 year or less with
the right guidance.

Find someone who has
already built a successful
business.

1. Be careful with private
information

Meet one wrong person and it
could ruin your life. My mom

lost everything and we became
homeless because we trusted the
wrong people.


===== 2023-08-24_13-05-23_UTC_3.jpg =====

2. Don’t think your job
is “safe”

No matter what, you're still just

“an expense” to the company
you're working for. It'd take them
less than a few days to replace you.
Have control over your own life.

3. Be healthy and take
care of your body

Without a healthy body, you can’t
have a healthy brain. Take care of
your health and body, and treat it
like a temple. Only then you can
become the best version of yourself.

Take time out today to tag
somebody that you know is working
hard and tell them you're proud of
them. Whether they're working hard
to be a better person, run a business,
or chase a dream. You never know
who may need to hear those words
to keep going

===== 2023-08-26_15-00-01_UTC.jpg =====
Your partner coming to you about
something you've done wrong isn’t
a personal attack. It’s a healthy
sign they value the relationship and
want to make it work — it's a heads

you stay. That's emotional maturity.
That's commitment. That's love.

been you.


===== 2023-08-28_22-42-09_UTC.jpg =====
When something isn't right for
you, your soul rejects it and tries
to warn you in many different
ways. Pay attention to how things
make you feel and what
emotions they bring up in you.
These are all messages. If
something is not right for you, let
it go.

A good connection can be ruined over
the simple fact you miscommunicated,
or chose to not communicate at all. A
good connection can be easily lost,
because you chose to ghost instead of

===== 2023-08-30_06-11-55_UTC.jpg =====
You disrespect yourself everytime
you say yes when you want to say
no. You call it loyalty, love, or
friendship. Really you're just hoping
someone will see how amazing you

Consistency can show how much
someone really cares. It’s easier to
do a great job every once in awhile,
but to show up multiple times, and
in a short time frame with the
same level of devotion is really
sending a message.

In 2021, | was on vacation with a friend in Colombia
(S. America), and | saw a girl on the streets clearly
offering herself to men passing by.

It broke my heart. So | did something weird -

| asked her out to dinner [*Calm down - not what
you think >>]

She turned me down. “If | have dinner with you
- I'll lose time when | can be making money.”

So | offered to not only pay for dinner, but ALSO
pay $50 USD for 1 hour of her time (ridiculous, but
creative).

After thinking about it - she said yes [it gets even
crazier >]

To be VERY clear: From the start | had ZERO
intention of having s*x with her.

It was pure ministry and servanthood - | was
looking to see if | can get her out of the tragedy
she couldn't even see she was in.

So we sat down, and | just bluntly asked: “Why
are you doing this to yourself?”

And she just broke down into tears. Told me her
father (sole bread-winner for family) died of
cancer a year before...

And money got so bad she had to drop out of
college to work odd jobs to get by.

But NONE of it was enough - and prostitution
was so much more profitable (so she did it literally
to save for school and send money back home).

| knew at that moment | had to do something.

So | made her a deal: “I will fund your remaining
2 years in school for you, under ONE condition.

You stop prostitution RIGHT NOW, go back home
AND church (she fell out of faith with Jesus)

You send me report cards monthly, and if | see any
Bs or hints of prostitution, | pull funding.

She agreed...

2 years later, she graduated, is employed, and
taking care of her family with a story that inspires
thousands in her hometown.

And NONE of this would've been possible if |
didn't have the financial ability to do this.

You can't pour into others if your cup is empty...
