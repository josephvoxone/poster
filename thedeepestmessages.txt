IF YOU DON'T
WANT TO BE
AVERAGE, BUILD
THESE 7 HABITS:

(swipe leit)


===== 2022-12-15_01-08-01_UTC_2.jpg =====
1) Get into deep work
Your focus is a currency.

How you spend it is your biggest
investment.

1. Block off a few hours
2. Focus on | thing
3. Remove distractions

This'll get you ahead of 90% of
people.


===== 2022-12-15_01-08-01_UTC_3.jpg =====
2) Optimize your time

Your time is your most powerful
asset.

Create systems to save it:
e Task delegation
e Email automation
¢ Logic based frameworks

You can use Zapier to do 90% of
this.


===== 2022-12-15_01-08-01_UTC_4.jpg =====
3) Look at things diagnostically

Instead of focusing on the
negative, ask yourself:

What am I in control of?
What can | do better?
How can I improve things?

A problem-solving mindset will
help you move past roadblocks
much faster.


===== 2022-12-15_01-08-01_UTC_5.jpg =====
4) Be resourceful

Ignorance is a choice in the Internet
age.

Need an answer? Google it.

Got a question? Send a Twitter
DM.

Don't know how to do something?
YouTube it.

The solutions to your problems are
at your fingertips.


===== 2022-12-15_01-08-01_UTC_6.jpg =====
5) Create a high value network

Evolution designed humans to get
along with each other for survival.

Which means you'll adopt the
traits, habits, and mindsets of
those around you.

Reduce time with people who hold
you back. Increase time with those
who can pull you forward.


===== 2022-12-15_01-08-01_UTC_7.jpg =====
6) Take care of yourself

Hustle culture told us the path to
success involved all work and no
rest.

But that's the path to burnout,
mediocrity, and regret.

Take care of your body with exercise.
Take care of your mind with sleep.
Take care of your spirit with
meditation.


===== 2022-12-15_01-08-01_UTC_8.jpg =====
7) Read quality books
Books have a high ROL.

You get decades of knowledge
condensed in a few hours of
reading.

The time, money, and mistakes you
save yourself are well worth the
investment.

Make it a daily habit and you'll get
yearly returns.

Our natural state of being is joy, love, and peace
fore, any thinking that we do will only take us aw, y from
those natural states of being, which is why whenev wef
extremely stressed, we are having a LOT of thinking going
on. The strength of the negative emotion we feel is in

proportion to how much thinking we are doing in th

On the other hand, the intensity of the positive emo!

we feel is inversely proportional to the amount of thi

we are doing in the moment. In other words, the less

of our unpleasant experience, we see it for what it truly is,
Then we allow it to settle by giving it space, and slowly we

will see how we begin to have a clear mind again.

You can also compare thinking to quicksand. The more
that we fight our thinking, the more it amplifies the negative
emotions and the worse it gets. The same is true for quick-
sand. If we’re in quicksand, the way out isn’t to fight it. If
we panic and frantically try to fight it, it only makes things
worse by tightening the grip it has on us and pulling us un-
der faster. The only way out is to stop struggling and allow-
ing the natural buoyancy of your body to take over to bring
you back up to the surface with ease. The only way to break
free from our thinking is to let go and trust that our natural
inner wisdom will guide us back to clarity and peace like it

To summarize, we do not have to try to "think positive"
to experience love, joy, bliss, and any positive emotions we
want because it is our natural state to feel those emotions,
The only times we don't naturally feel these emotions is
when we begin to think about the thoughts we're having,
thus blocking the direct connection to Infinite Intelligence
and we feel stressed, anxious, depressed, and fearful. It is
not about the content of our thinking, but that we're think-
ing, which is the root cause of our suffering. The intensity
of the negative emotions is directly correlated to the
amount of thinking we have going on in the present. The
less thinking we have, the more space we create for positive

emotions to naturally surface.

TNR once said, “Thought is not reality; yet it is

vastly different from the person right next to us. An exam-

our experience of life 1s created from the inside out.

It's not about the events that happen in our lives but
our interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or
bad about something. This is how people in third world
countries can be happier than people in first world coun-
tries and people in first world countries can be more miser-
able than people in third world countries.

Our feelings do not come from external events, but
from our own thinking about the events. Therefore, we can
only ever feel what we are thinking.

Now before you throw this book across the room and

to feel all of these negative, unwanted emotions and making
us create reasons as to why we can’t do it or why we
shouldn’t want it.

The only thing that was useful and helpful was the ini-
tial thought that popped into your mind when I first asked
how much you wanted to make. All of the thinking that
happened after was destructive and unhelpful.

Thoughts create. Thinking destroys.

The reason thinking destroys is because as soon as we
begin to think about the thoughts, we cast our own limiting
beliefs, judgements, criticisms, programming, and condi-
tioning onto the thought, thinking of infinite reasons as to
why we can’t do it and why we can’t have it.

Without thinking, we prevent all negative program-
ming and judgements from tarnishing the initial thought of
what you want to create.

I need to start living more. Dressing
up more, going places, going on

time after work to do things I enjoy.
Just living. Life is short.

1. Appreciate happiness when it is there.
2. Sip, don’t gulp.
3: Be gentle with yourself. Work less. Sleep more.

There is absolutely nothing in the past that you can
change. That's basic physics.

5. Beware of Tuesdays. And Octobers.

6. Kurt Vonnegut was right. ‘Reading and writing are
the most nourishing forms of meditation anyone has

so far found.’
7. Listen more than you talk.

8. Don’t feel guilty about being idle. More harm is prob-
ably done to the world through work than idleness.


===== 2023-05-13_16-18-29_UTC_2.jpg =====
9. Be aware that you are breathing.

to. Wherever you are, at any moment, try and find some-
thing beautiful. A face, a line out of a poem, the
clouds out of a window, some graffiti, a wind farm.

Beauty cleans the mind.

a1. Hate is a pointless emotion to have inside you. It
is like eating a scorpion to punish it for stinging

you.
12. Go for a run. Then do some yoga.
13. Shower before noon.

14. Look at the sky. Remind yourself of the cosmos. Seek
vastness at every opportunity, in order to see the

smallness of yourself.
15. Be kind.
16, Understand that thoughts are thoughts. If they are unrea-

sonable, reason with them, even if you have no reason

left. You are the observer of your mind, not its victim.

17. Do not watch TV aimlessly. Do not go on social
media aimlessly. Always be aware of what you are

239


===== 2023-05-13_16-18-29_UTC_3.jpg =====
doing, and why you are doing it. Don’t value TV
less. Value it more. Then you will watch it less.

Unchecked distractions will lead you to distraction.

18. Sit down. Lie down. Be still. Do nothing. Observe.
Listen to your mind. Let it do what it does without

judging it. Let it go, like the Snow Queen in Frozen.
19. Don’t worry about things that probably won’t happen,

20. Look at trees. Be near trees. Plant trees. (Trees are
great.)

21. Listen to that yoga instructor on YouTube, and ‘walk
as if you are kissing the Earth with your feet’.

22. Live. Love. Let go. The three Ls.
23. Alcohol maths. Wine multiplies itself by itself. The

more you have, the more you are likely to have. And
if it’s hard to stop at one glass, it will be impossible

at three. Addition is multiplication.

24. Beware of the gap. The gap between where you are
and where you want to be. Simply thinking of the
gap widens it. And you end up falling through.

25. Read a book without thinking about finishing it.


===== 2023-05-13_16-18-29_UTC_4.jpg =====
26. No drug in the universe will make you feel better,
at the deepest level, than being kind to other people.

27. Listen to what Hamlet — literature’s most famous
depressive — told Rosencrantz and Guildenstern.
‘There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking

makes it so.’

28. If someone loves you, let them. Believe in that
love. Live for them, even when you feel there is no

point.

29. You don’t need the world to understand you. It’s fine.
Some people will never really understand things they

haven’t experienced. Some will. Be grateful.

30. Jules Verne wrote of the ‘Living Infinite’. This is
the world of love and emotion that is like a ‘sea’. If
we can submerge ourselves in it, we find infinity in

ourselves, and the space we need to survive.

31. Three in the morning is never the time to try and
sort out your life.

241


===== 2023-05-13_16-18-29_UTC_5.jpg =====
Be: Remember that there is nothing weird about you. You
are just a human, and everything you do and feel js
a natural thing, because we are natural animals. You
are nature. You are a hominid ape. You are in the

world and the world is in you. Everything connects,

33. Don’t believe in good or bad, or winning and losing,
or victory and defeat, or up and down. At your lowest
and at your highest, whether you are happy or
despairing or calm or angry, there is a kernel of you

that stays the same. That is the you that matters.

34. Don’t worry about the time you lose to despair. The
time you will have afterwards has just doubled its

value. ~

35. Be transparent to yourself. Make a greenhouse for

your mind. Observe.

36. Read Emily Dickinson. Read Graham Greene. Read
Italo Calvino. Read Maya Angelou. Read anything
you want. Just read. Books are possibilities. They are
escape routes. They give you options when you have

none. Each one can be a home for an uprooted mind.

37. Ifthe sunis shining, and you can be outside, be outside.


===== 2023-05-13_16-18-29_UTC_6.jpg =====
38. Remember that the key thing about life on earth is
change. Cars rust. Paper yellows. Technology dates.
Caterpillars become butterflies. Nights morph into
days. Depression lifts.

39. Just when you feel you have no time to relax, know
that this is the moment you most need to make time

to relax.

40. Be brave. Be strong. Breathe, and keep going. You

will thank yourself later.

our experience of life is created from the inside out.
It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but

our interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or

"People have a hard time letting go of their suffering.
Out of a fear of the unknown, they prefer suffering
that is familiar.” — Thich Nhat Hanh

A ee is an important distinction to make when speak-
ing about suffering. When I mention suffering in this

not in reality itself. Reality is that the event happened
with no meaning, thinking, or interpretation of it.
Any meaning or thinking we give the event is on us and
that is how our perception of reality is created. This is how
our experience of life is created from the inside out.
It's not about the events that happen in our lives, but

our interpretation of them, which causes us to feel good or

ad about something. This is how people in third world
can be happier than people in first world coun-

WHY DO WE EVEN THINK?

“T think and think and think, I've thought myself out
of happiness one million times, but never once into it.” |

~~ Jonathan Safran Foer

e as humans have evolved to. develop a sophisti-
NS ability to rationalize, analyze, and think be-
cause it simply helped us survive. Our minds do an incred-
ible job to keep us alive, but it does not help us thrive. It i Is

Are babies naturally stressed, anxious, fearful, » and self coy,
scious? Or are they naturally in a state of bliss, happj
and love?

Our natural state of being is joy, love, and peace
fore, any thinking that we do will only take us aw, y from
those natural states of being, which is why whenev wef
extremely stressed, we are having a LOT of thinking going
on. The strength of the negative emotion we feel is in

proportion to how much thinking we are doing in th
ment.

On the other hand, the intensity of the positive emo!

we feel is inversely proportional to the amount of thi

we are doing in the moment. In other words, the less

_ ing we have going on, the stronger the Positive emotion

eel in the present.
i To see the truth in this, recall a few other memories yi
hen you were extremely stressed and anxious and
, thinking was going on at the time.

of our unpleasant experience, we see it for what it truly is,
Then we allow it to settle by giving it space, and slowly we

will see how we begin to have a clear mind again.

You can also compare thinking to quicksand. The more
that we fight our thinking, the more it amplifies the negative
emotions and the worse it gets. The same is true for quick-
sand. If we’re in quicksand, the way out isn’t to fight it. If
we panic and frantically try to fight it, it only makes things
worse by tightening the grip it has on us and pulling us un-
der faster. The only way out is to stop struggling and allow-
ing the natural buoyancy of your body to take over to bring
you back up to the surface with ease. The only way to break
free from our thinking is to let go and trust that our natural
inner wisdom will guide us back to clarity and peace like it

The root cause of our suffering is our own thinking.

Now before you throw this book across the room and
light it on fire, I'm not saying that this is all in our heads and
that it isn't real. Our perception of reality is very real. We
will feel what we think, and our feelings are real. That is
completely undeniable. However, our thinking will look
like an inevitable, unchangeable reality to us until we begin
seeing how our reality is created. If we know that we can
only ever feel what we are thinking, then we know that we

on YouTube without showing his

Follow him to learn how
it works.


===== 2023-09-30_13-02-01_UTC_2.jpg =====
1. HARD WORK

Don't believe in luck, believe in
hard work. Stop trying to rush the
process or searching for a
shortcut. There is none.


===== 2023-09-30_13-02-01_UTC_3.jpg =====
2. PATIENCE

If you are losing the patience, you
are losing the battle. First nothing
happens, then it happens slowly
and suddenly all at once. Most
people give up at stage one.


===== 2023-09-30_13-02-01_UTC_4.jpg =====
3. SACRIFICE

If you don't sacrifice for what you
want, then what you want becomes
the sacrifice. Everything has its price.
The question is: Are you ready to pay
it for the life you desire?


===== 2023-09-30_13-02-01_UTC_5.jpg =====
4. CONSISTENCY

Consistency is what transforms
average info excellence. Without
consistency, you will never achieve
greater success.


===== 2023-09-30_13-02-01_UTC_6.jpg =====
5. DISCIPLINE

Motivation gets you going, but
discipline keeps you growing. There
will be days when you don't feel like
doing it. You have to push through
those days regardless of how you feel.


===== 2023-09-30_13-02-01_UTC_7.jpg =====
6. SELF - CONFIDENCE

Confidence is, I'll be fine if they don’t
like me. There will always be someone
judging you for who you are and what
you want from life.

to avoid >
