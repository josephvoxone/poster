The difference between depression and sadness.
Comparison is the thief of joy.
Even when you trust someone, keep some things to yourself.
If you want to build something worthwhile, be ready for criticism.
Your mental health is way more important than your career will ever be.
You become an unstoppable force when you realize that you can do it alone.
Be okay with people not liking you; most don't even like themselves.
Not everything will go according to plan; always be ready to adapt.
You can always choose to be happy no matter what happens in your life; being sad is never an option.
Don't waste your time stressing about things you can't control.
I don't care who is doing better than me. I am doing better than I was last year. It's me vs me.
The worst feeling is not knowing if you should wait or give up.
The friends who you have zero photos with, but a thousand memories with.
The friend who knows you the best.
Friends who listen to you even at 3 am.
The friends who make you forget about your problems.
The friends who you laugh so hard with that it gives you a stomachache.
Loyalty behind your back is really top tier.
If you can handle my overthinking, I'll literally marry you.
It's so crazy the things you beg someone to do; another person will do with no hesitation.
If my nervous system doesn't feel at peace around you, I gotta let you go.
My favorite memory was meeting you.
We deserve road trips, beaches, and hangouts in this stressful year.
She wanted to call him first. He wanted to call her first. No one called each other. The end.
If you have been brutally broken but still have the courage to be gentle to other living beings, then you're a badass with a heart of an angel.
Imagine someone who wants to know your past not to use it against you but because they wanna understand you.
The dumbest thing you can do is lose a girl that's been down for you since y'all met.
People like you don't happen often. Never forget about how rare you are.
Sometimes people need their own space. They're not cutting you off; they just need time to breathe and take care of themselves. That has nothing to do with you.
Dating is just wondering why someone is single then figuring it out.
I'm in my, "You gotta prove everything you say to me" phase of my life.
Imagine raising a mini you with the person you love.
I want my children to grow up seeing what real love is between two people.
I used to think communication was the key until I realized comprehension is. You can communicate all you want with someone, but if they don't understand you, it's silent chaos.
Being close to me means honoring that I often need to disappear into myself, into spirit, into silence, and not taking that personally.
I think I healed too much, I don't like nobody.
Life lesson: Nobody really tells you this, but sometimes the healing hurts more than the wound.
When someone helps you when they're struggling too, that’s not help, that's love. Read that again.
You're the most permanent thing in your life. Choose you, always.
The most convincing sign that someone is truly living their best life is their lack of desire to show the world that they're living their best life. Your best life won't seek validation.
You made that choice to improve yourself for a reason. Don't go backward to habits, people, or situations that weren't helping you evolve.
Parked car conversations are lowkey therapy sessions.
Be selective. Learn who to “know” and who to “no.”
When you are a real one, you're gonna go through a lot of shit. That's just part of the journey.
The universe will softly tell you that something isn't a good fit for you. People, places, ideologies, careers, social circles. It will gradually turn up the volume until you hear it. Eventually, if you continue to refuse to listen, it will violently remove you.
“I can make time.”
I don't believe in competition because 1. you can't be me & 2. I don't wanna be you.
They'll never respect you if you keep giving them chances to disrespect you. Know your worth.
I'm at the "don't talk to me unless you wanna wife me" stage.
I respect a man who is vocal. Tell me why you're into me. Tell me why I pissed you off & tell me how I can fix it. Tell me everything. Talk.
Know the difference between being patient and wasting your time.
“You took so long in the shower.” Yeah, I was at a concert.
Always remember, someone's effort is a reflection of their interest in you.
Mention someone you're thankful for.
Hearing “I'm proud of you” when you're having a hard time hits different.
I no longer pour into cups that do not pour into mine. Family, friends, or associates. Read that again.
Dear best friend: I am tagging you here, so you remember that you're not allowed to leave me, not now or ever.
Some chapters just have to close without closure.
Relax, they'll miss you when they can't replace you.
Someone said: “Be careful who you save, you could be interrupting their karma,” and I can't stop thinking about it.
If you get that gut feeling that something isn't right about a person or situation, trust it.
If you get that gut feeling that something isn't right about a person or situation, trust it.
I pray my best friend gets everything they're working hard for. They deserve it.
Do you ever talk to someone so much that they become a part of your daily routine, and when they're not around, your days kinda suck?
I have no more fight in me when it comes to friendships and relationships. If you want to go, just go.
If you have the power to eat alone in a restaurant or sit alone in a cinema hall, then you can do anything in your life.
I really want to experience traveling with a person I’m in love with.
You owe it to yourself to fully show up in this lifetime. Get off autopilot.
One song can make you remember a lot.
Your child's mental health is more important than their grades.
Trust the timing of your life. Especially when time says NO.
Commitment isn't scary, wasting years of your life is.
When someone helps you when they're struggling too, that's not help, that's love. Read that again.
Do you ever look at someone and just think: “I'm so glad I met you.”
Distance doesn't kill a relationship but less conversation and late replies do.
I have no remorse for people that mess up with me. I make it too easy. I'm so easygoing, caring, and genuine. But once you're on the outside, you gotta stay there.
People will quit on you. You gotta get up every day and make sure you never quit on yourself.
Please, never joke about someone's weight, facial features, insecurities, grades, parents, profession, appearance, scars, and misery. Please don't do that.
With the right person, you wouldn’t need to try so hard to feel valued, heard, seen, and loved.
Some of you don't even realize how you light up rooms and inspire people just by being you. You're literally magnetic, and you don't even realize it.
"I remember you said you like this, so I got it for you."
In 2 years, you really can be somewhere you never imagined. That's why it's so important to keep going.
Let's heal so we can stop accidentally hurting people we want to love because we are projecting our own wounds onto them.
How your partner reacts to your sadness and things that bother you should tell you all you need to know about how long the relationship should last.
How introverts make friends: 10% They don't, 90% An extrovert found them, liked them, and adopted them.
Learning how to keep calm and control your reaction when someone disrespects you and tries to trigger you is a whole different kind of healing.
Be okay with the fact that people hold different versions of you in their mind. Ultimately, who you know yourself to be is what matters the most.
The real flex is not having any drama associated with your life.
Healthy relationships are not found, they’re worked on and created.
I got a lot of love in me, but I just can't give it out how I used to.
Real friendships don’t need convo all the time, just know if you need me, I got you.
Shutting down instead of communicating is just as toxic as arguing.
I can't afford any more situations in my life that bring out the worst in me. It's exhausting and requires too much for me to recover from. I need calmness and gentleness in my life. Anything outside of that, I don't have the capacity for it.
If you can work 8 hours for someone else, you can work 2 hours for yourself.
Excuses make today easy, but tomorrow hard. Discipline makes today hard, but tomorrow easy.
This is what happens when you repress your emotions.
Divorce is ok. Breaking up is ok. Starting over is ok. Moving on is ok. Saying no is ok. Being alone is ok. What is not ok is staying somewhere that you aren't happy, valued, or appreciated. That is not ok.
I'm: O single, O taken, @ ignoring everyone else for that one person who ignores me at the end.
It's the principle of shit. If you don't want me doing it to you, don't do it to me.
"Disappointed, but not surprised" has been my biggest mood this year.
Be absolutely clear about who you are because people will constantly try to project their needs, desires, ideas, judgments onto you.
I honestly feel like I've come into people's lives to show them genuine love, and they've come into mine to teach me self-love.
Every day I get more & more reasons to not open up to people.
The older you get, you start to see how important privacy is. Not everyone needs to know what goes on with you.
That friend who is always ready to help you any day, anytime, and any situation.
My friends and I only talk shit about people who deserve it. We aren't gossipers, we're vigilantes.
Have you ever been attracted to somebody's voice? Cause it’s a real thing, I swear.
Controlling yourself from texting someone you badly want to talk to is a different kind of pain.
Defend your partner in public, correct them in private. That's law.
Sometimes, I just stare at you because I wonder how I even got so lucky to be with you.
My therapist made a life-changing statement during therapy today: "You don't have to feel hopeful about the future, it's enough to just be curious about what is coming." I can't even describe just how eye-opening that one sentence was.
Thank you for being exactly who you are and for offering me a friendship I've wanted and needed my whole life.
Allow yourself to say no, so you can say yes to what really matters.
It’s not overreacting, we all have different sensitivity. If it hurts, it hurts.
There's always 3 best friends: The trouble maker, the one with the I-don't-care attitude, and the innocent one.
Build together. Make money together. Stay loyal. Make each other smile. Stay low key. Don't tell the world your every move and work as a team.
Just heard someone say, "Some of us never found time to be happy because we were too busy trying to be strong." I felt that, I felt that a lot.
Your worth didn't decrease because someone else didn't know how to value it.
Sometimes, home is a person.
The love is genuine over here, that's why it ain't for everybody.
Be a reflection of what you'd like to receive. If you want love, give love. If you want truth, be truthful. If you want respect, give respect. What you give out will return to you.
When they say you can't do it, do it twice and take pics.
Every negative thing that has made you cry over the years will fade away and be replaced with happiness, laughter, love, and blessings.
Only put your energy into things you have a future with.
If someone really loves you, no matter how many other people they meet, their feelings for you won't change. A real lover can't be stolen.
The intimacy of communicating and fixing things together is top-tier.
What you want exists, don't settle until you get it.
May you be covered in your next relationship and not confused.
I seriously just wanna be with you right now.
Sometimes, being single is the price you pay for knowing exactly what you want and not settling for anything less until you receive it.
I’m the luckiest person in the world to be able to call you my partner.
I never wanted to argue, I just wanted you to understand how I felt.
Saw a quote that said, "Thank you for letting me go because I wouldn't have walked away," and that hit different.
Trust your gut, it’s rarely wrong.
Someone said, “I'd rather adjust to your absence than be frustrated by your presence.” I felt that.
A plus side to being my friend is that you can come to my house in your pajamas, and I won't judge you because I will also be in my pajamas.
If I don't marry this girl, someone else will, and I can’t live with that.
One conversation could fix so many things. Just by listening and being honest. But people always think you're trying to argue instead of trying to communicate.
As soon as you fall back, they crawl back. Just remember that every missed call doesn’t deserve a call back.
My life went smoother when I realized that I don't have to react to every situation. Let stuff be.
Being loved wholeheartedly and in a healthy way is such a blessing.
I have no more fight in me when it comes to friendships and relationships... If you want to go, go.
If you don't see the value of having me by your side, I won't convince you.
Saying how you feel will never ruin a real connection.
If you break someone and they still wish you the best, you've lost the greatest thing for you.
Saw a husband holding his wife's hair back because it was very windy and she was trying to eat a donut. That's the type of support this world needs more of.
Behind every strong person is a story that gave them two choices: sink or swim.
You can't be around people who think your growth is competition to them.
Hard pills to swallow: If they wanna talk to you, they will. If they wanna be with you, they will. If they wanna make things work, they will. Don't let things be one-sided. It's not healthy, and it's not fair to you.
There are two types of tired: one that requires rest and one that requires peace.
It's time for people with good hearts to finally win.
Rock bottom will teach you more than mountain tops ever will.
I just want to hug you for hours.
I wanna be the last one you love.
In my dream, you love me too.
If you do not make time for your wellness, then you will be forced to make time for your illness. Read that again...
I think one of my favorite feelings is laughing with someone and realizing halfway through how much you enjoy them and their existence.
My grandma just said, "It's easy to say you're over someone if you aren't seeing them. The challenge is to look them in the eye, see their smile, and hear their voice and still be able to say, 'This is not what I want anymore,' and I don't know why, but that just hit me too deep.
Removing yourself from shit that repeatedly triggers your mental health and hurts your heart is top-tier self-care.
Finally realized I was never asking for too much, I was just asking the wrong person.
Never be an option. Be their priority, or move on.
Any relationship that requires you to be a quiet or more watered-down version of yourself for it to "work out" is not the relationship for you.
Truth is, I miss you. All the time. Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day.
Dopest shit ever is mutual love, when you both just enjoy the heck out of each other.
The 5 by 5 rule... if it isn’t going to matter in 5 years, then don't spend more than 5 minutes being upset about it.
We often want it so badly that we ruin it before it begins. Overthinking. Fantasizing. Imagining. Expecting. Worrying. Doubting. Just let it naturally evolve.
Being around the wrong environment and wrong people will make you forget your worth, and stunt your growth.
May you experience a miracle this week that reminds you that everything is actually working in your favor.
The older I get, the more I realize the value of staying low key, of cultivating your circle and only letting certain people in. You can be open, honest, and real while still understanding not everyone deserves a seat at your table.
I'll do anything 4 u if I love u. That's why I gotta watch who I love.
3 lessons I learned this year: To leave people where they're at, accept situations for what they are, and not every action needs a reaction.
Distance is my new answer to disrespect. I no longer react, I no longer argue, I no longer dive into drama. I simply remove my presence.
Your emotional intelligence and intuition will offend everyone who can't run game on you.
The wrong one will find you in peace and leave you in pieces. The right one will find you in pieces and lead you to peace.
Just a reminder that getting no message is also a message.
I think I’m the nicest rudest most caring nonchalant idgaf person you'll ever meet.
Date someone who stays obsessed with you, not just in the beginning.
If we are in a relationship, I don't care how many people try to talk or flirt with you... but it's what you say back that really matters.
Breakups hurt. But losing someone who doesn’t respect and appreciate you is actually a gain, not a loss.
Trust how you feel around certain people. If you're not at peace, getting bad vibes, or your intuition is telling you something is off... believe it.
Your inner happiness and mental wellness should be a priority in everything you do.
My response to every situation is "it's all good" because even if it isn't, it will be.
Stop being so available for the person that always puts you last.
Your own people won't support you until strangers do, and will turn around and ask you, "why you treating me like a Stranger."
Interviewer: Can you explain this gap in your resume?
Me: Yes, that's when I didn't have a job.
The first time I met you, I had no damn idea I'd love you this much.
To my favorite person ever, be safe, every day please.
I've learned that not speaking on things just to keep the "peace" is actually a trauma response. When you do this, you disrespect YOUR boundaries. No matter what, keep taking up space and use your voice.
Do good. It will come back to you in unexpected ways.
I think when you’re transitioning from being a people pleaser to someone with more boundaries it’s so weird, because it’s hard to tell if you’re being mean or if you're just listening to your own feelings because you’re so used to this & only thinking about others.
Once I feel like I spoke on a situation too many times, I’m just going to let you do you...
Communicating is one thing, but your tone while communicating is everything.
This chapter in my life is called: knowing my worth and acting accordingly. No more settling for less, I know what I deserve.
"If I really care, I'll try like 400 times. But once I'm done, it's over."
Nothing hurts more than your favorite person turning into a life lesson.
Normalize not forcing connections with people. It flows, or it goes. If someone doesn't see the value in having you by their side, don’t try to convince them.
Shoutout to the people who haven't felt okay lately, but get up every day and refuse to quit. Stay strong.
I do not wanna hear nothing negative about nobody, we're all out here trying to make it.
You're not dating their cute face, height, or smile. You're dating their maturity, morals, & growth. Evaluate that before you catch feelings for something that doesn't deserve you.
Feeling understood is such a love language.
As you get older, you start to pay more attention to people's mindset rather than their looks.
I don't know who needs to hear this, but they're always going to choose themselves, and you should do the same.
7 hours can feel like 30 minutes with the right person.
You will always find love draining if you date people you have to raise.
Your self-respect has to be stronger than your feelings.
I enjoy sharing myself with a small select group of people, the rest can wonder who I really am forever.
Best dating advice I ever got from my mom was, "The signs you ignore in the beginning just end up being the reason you leave later. You know right away who's good and bad for you. Don't ignore that."
What's meant to be in your life will be there. There is no need to worry, stress, or force.
Look, I’m a nice person, but I’m not here to take your shit.
Couples don't breakup anymore, one person acts like an asshole till the other person can't take it anymore.
Being called 'My Love' is so cute, it literally melts my heart.
Never give up on someone you can't go a day without thinking about.
Idk who needs to hear this, but it’s okay to start over and let someone else love you.
One thing life has showed me: Growth isn't for everybody. Some people just want to stay the same forever.
I'm naturally a giver, but life has taught me to stop going above and beyond for certain people.
Nobody has played me more than I have played myself. I be knowing shit and still be tryna give people the benefit of the doubt.
I'm huge on my priorities this year. If I miss out, I miss out.
I believe true love meets you in your mess & not your best. When someone sticks around no matter how hard things get, they really love you.
Imagine someone listening to a song and thinking of you.
Once you start loving yourself, people will no longer look good to you unless they are good for you.
Most people end up leaving or losing their partner because they were too young to understand the value of the love they received.
You deserve someone who replies fast. You deserve someone who never gets tired of your pointless stories. You deserve someone who wants to be with you every minute of the day. You deserve someone who is sure about you.
Nobody can make me jealous with a person I was miserable with.
Doing the opposite of what everyone tells you to do.
Love the person who tries their best to understand you.
One of the best feelings is finally losing your attachment to somebody who isn't good for you.
Cutting people off and letting them live with whatever delusional story suits them best.
A tip for mental health... learn to distinguish who deserves an explanation, who deserves an answer, and who deserves absolutely nothing.
A lot of things ending & a lot of things beginning. I'm welcoming it all...
I can't afford any more situations in my life that bring out the worst in me. It's exhausting and requires too much for me to recover from. I need calmness and gentleness in my life. Anything outside of that I don't have the capacity for.
Never lose a person who immediately apologizes, genuinely cares for you, never fails to make you smile, makes you feel like the luckiest person in the world, and always wants to be with you.
I think we have multiple soulmates & the one you end up with depends on the work you've done to evolve your own soul. I think there's a soulmate for every level of your journey. I think as you grow, so does the quality of your partnerships.
Your name popping up in my notifications just makes my heart soooo happy, you have no idea.
Removing yourself instead of returning negative energy is growth.
I respect a person who knows their energy is off and keeps their distance because they don't want to transfer it onto you. I don't think some people understand how real that is.
Heavy on... I'm not mad at you. That's who you are. That's your character. Be that character, but I don't have to deal with it.
There are two types of people in the world: "it's already 10pm" and "it's only 10pm," and they marry each other.
Some people just want the attention of having you without the responsibility of being committed to you. Read that twice.
What I have with you, I don't want with anyone else.
Some women only dated one man and found their soulmate. Then there's me out here doing auditions.
If your girlfriend/boyfriend/friend needs reassurance on how you feel, just give it to them. Damn. We're humans and go through shit. It's nice to feel wanted.
Life humbles you. As you grow old, you stop chasing the big things and start valuing the little things. Alone time, enough sleep, a good diet, long walks, and quality time with loved ones. Simplicity becomes the ultimate goal.
She doesn't mind that you're busy... just find a way to include her.
I used to think communication was the key until I realized comprehension is. You can communicate all you want with someone, but if they don't understand you, it's silent chaos.
I'm actually such a forgiving person, so if I genuinely stop speaking to someone, they did way too much.
When I say I'm not in a mental space to have certain conversations, it's because I'm highly aware that in that moment I'm not the best version of myself, and engaging with me at this current time may lead to things not ending well.
Your taste in people will change when you learn to love yourself.
Don't worry about what I am doing, worry about why you're worried about what I'm doing.
When someone helps you when they're struggling too, that's not help, that's love. Read that again.
Notice how happy you get when you literally just do you.
At this point in life, I don't stress myself to communicate with people. If you talk to me then okay, If not then okay.
Anything a person loves, they take care of. Remember that.
A wise person once told me, "let people do what they wanna do, so you see what they'd rather do." That'll answer all the questions you have.
When I talk to you, my day gets a whole lot better.
Not all relationships will lead you to marriage. Some will inspire you to stay single.
Why is life testing me so hard lately? I mean I'll survive but dang, give me a break bro.
You automatically lose my respect if you act different to impress other people.
You learn a lot about a person when you see how they treat you when you aren't on good terms.
I could never let anyone go through my camera roll, there are too many weird screenshots and saved stuff that I have no valid explanation for.
Traveling together is pretty high on my list of love languages.
You cannot repeatedly disappoint somebody & expect their energy to still crave you.
You can literally feel when it's time to move into your life’s next chapter.
Call me selfish, but I don’t want anyone to know you the way I do.
"Don't be my peace; I have that. Be at peace with yourself so we can love each other correctly."
I'm too late for being your first love, but I'll do anything to be your last.
Being loved is the minimum. Make sure you are also being respected, prioritized, supported, desired, understood.
I found the person who makes me want to be better and do better.
I have such a big heart, but once I stop caring, it's a wrap.
When maturity hits you, silence is better than arguing.
You fall in love with the little things about someone, like the sound of their laughter and the way their smile forms.
Always remember, people know exactly what they’re doing.
I like consistency. Do not introduce me to a vibe you cannot maintain.
Remember, the right person won't make you feel like you're asking for too much.
My best friend has the audacity to live far away from me.
Meeting someone great in your "I'm gonna be single" phase is crazy.
One person's “nah, you require too much." Is another person's “that’s all you need?” Don't settle.
Relationships get stronger when both are willing to understand mistakes and forgive each other.
Just wanna be alone, but with you.
The relationship I’m in now is the one I want forever.
Set boundaries and be okay with losing people who are not for you.
Crazy how someone can be on your mind all day and they have no idea.
Sometimes you just gotta be like “it was fun while it lasted” & move the tf on with your life.
It's normal to argue in relationships, but from that argument, a better understanding should come, Not more separation.
Marry a guy who speaks good words to you even when he's mad at you. The best partner is when he is angry, he won't insult you. Because he has much respect for you and does not want to lose you in a simple argument.
I talk to the same 2 people every day. If someone says they know me, they are lying.
Having a supportive partner can change everything.
Breakups are okay. Starting over is okay. Moving on is okay. Saying no is okay. Being alone is okay. What is not okay is staying somewhere where you aren't happy, valued, or appreciated, that's not okay.
You have to love yourself enough to not tolerate disrespect, disloyalty, and wishy-washy feelings. If a person doesn't value you, move on.
You've been trying to save people your entire life. Now, it's time to save yourself.
I say ‘no worries’ a lot for a person that is full of worry.
I started realizing how beautiful I am, and I’m not even talking about looks, I started realizing my worth. I’m so fire.
Picture this: It's 10 years from now. You're married. Nice home. Good job. It's Christmas. Your kids are asleep. You and your spouse are on the couch having a drink and watching TV. It's snowing outside, and tomorrow's Saturday. All the hard work was worth it. You made it.
I'll choose you, every time.
If you repeatedly have to tell someone the SAME EXACT thing about how you feel and nothing changes, understand they don't respect you.
God ended a lot of friendships and toxic relationships that I wanted to keep forever. At first I didn't understand, now I'm like... Thank God.
My love language is telling you random things about my day.
I get distant when I feel the vibe is off.
Stay hydrated, go make some money, and surround yourself with people who love you for you.
The best chapter of my life was meeting the friends I have right now.
That “ignoring each other” game can turn into a “never hearing from me again” game real fast.
Normalize not telling everyone everything. Not everyone wants what's best for you.
I wish I could see you every day.
Do yourself a favor and delete some people in your life.
I don't care how much I like you, I'll leave you alone if you make me feel confused.
I overheard a girl saying "I'm not over him but I'm over it" and that's the most accurate shit I've heard in a while.
If I really care, I'll try like 400 times but once I'm done, BITCH IT'S OVER.
You'll never have to negotiate your way into a heart that wants you there.
Stop accepting things you are really not okay with. You are draining yourself.
I respect someone who is vocal. Tell me why you're into me. Tell me why I pissed you off & tell me how I can fix it. Tell me everything. Talk.
If we're dating, the relationship I have with your mom, dad, siblings, etc. is important to me. Their approval & love are wanted as well.
I'm single cause I ask for too much... you know, no games, truthfulness, respect... way too much.
We all need a "text me when you get home," "did you eat," "I'm proud of you" kind of person in our lives.
I'm stuck between, I'm too young to be rushing things and I'm too old to be wasting time.
To crave somebody’s presence instead of their body is the purest form of intimacy.
The dumbest thing you can do is lose a girl that's been down for you since y'all met.
Some people are so rare, not even talking about looks. They're just pure & good-hearted.
You can never be “just friends” with someone you've fallen in love with.
Distance is my new response. I don't return energy. I remove myself.
You didn't wake up today to be begging anyone for their time or attention. Go where you are celebrated.
Truth is, I miss you. All the time. Every second. Every minute. Every hour. Every day.
You don't have to apologize for moving on when you gave them more than enough chances to get their shit together and act right. Read it again.
Top-tier compliment: You look like you really love yourself.
I appreciate effort. No matter how small, big, or irrelevant it is, I appreciate effort.
Taking a break from somebody will either make you realize how much you really love and miss them, or how much you really love your peace without them.
I saw something that said “if I'm a lot, go find less.” and that's the vibe. Forever.
Goofiness is so attractive to me. If you can keep me laughing, you got me forever.
Real friends talk sense into you. Fake ones agree with your every move.
Normalize, "I'm willing to work on it," instead of, "that's just how I am."
Anything you lose by being honest, you never had in the first place.
Just do right by people. Don't worry about if that energy is returned. That ain't on you.
Imagine listening to a love song and no one comes to your mind. That's the final stage of being completely single.
Your nervous system will naturally feel calm around people with pure intentions and authentic energy - trust it.
Somebody once told me, “someday your children are going to figure out who you are, just like you figured out who your parents are. Make sure you're being the person they can be proud of when they figure it out."
It's a beautiful thing when you get so comfortable with someone and you realize you're telling them things you've never said out loud before.
SAY IT WITH ME: By the end of the year I am going to have everything I prayed and worked hard for.
Note to self: For the sake of your mental health, take mixed signals as a no.
Being alone is not boring, for me it's my comfort zone. I love my own space.
“You're not insecure. You just have a need to feel emotionally safe” is a gem from my therapist that I will be holding on to for a very long time.
I'm two totally different people when I care and when I don't.
When they listen to you, understand your situation, and help you figure it out.
Don't allow others to consume you. If they don't call, go to sleep. If they don't message you, put away your phone & have a good day. If they are distant and refuse to tell you what's wrong, go home and do something fun. You live for yourself first. They are secondary.
The real glow-up isn't physical. It happens when you stop settling, people-pleasing, and compromising your boundaries. The real glow-up is when you finally recognize your worth.
It's nothing personal, but sometimes I don't feel like texting people back, and I don't know why. I just don't.
Even the strongest feelings expire when ignored and taken for granted.
Just because someone is "family" doesn't mean you have to tolerate lies, chaos, drama, manipulation, and disrespect.
Some of you don't even realize how you light up rooms and inspire people just by being you. You're literally magnetic and you don't even realize it.
Being loved wholeheartedly and in a healthy way is such a blessing.
Then one day unexpectedly, you meet the one who shows you how you should have been treated all along.
"I already booked us a trip.” —a love language
You deserve a calm love with someone who is good for your mental health and nervous system. Someone who is your safe space, your best friend, and soothes your soul during stressful situations.
I never wanted to argue, I just wanted you to understand how I felt.
Adult friendships be like, "I miss you let’s hang out in November."
One of the best signs of your growth is seeing yourself no longer worried, bothered, or hurt by the things that once used to drain you. You're getting better and it feels so good.
Just say lol and move on.
You are getting distracted again. You got dreams to chase. Not people to impress. Wake up.
It's okay to be sad after making the right decision.
A person who trusts no one now, once trusted someone too much.
Even if you hear a bad story about me, understand, there was a time I was good to those people, but they won't tell you that.
Do you ever just wanna check up on someone, but it's not your place anymore?
No matter where you're at in life, it only takes one big win to set you up forever. Keep going.
Just a reminder: If someone cares about you, you won't ever have to wonder how they feel, they'll constantly remind you.
Switching your mindset from "I hope I can do this" to "I'm going to make this happen" is such a game changer.
Heavy on... I'm not mad at you. That's who you are. That's your character. Be that character, but I don't have to deal with it.
I pray my best friend gets everything she's working hard for. She deserves it.
It's not my job to be likable. It's my job to be myself. The right people will gravitate.
When someone makes you feel safe. Safe to express. Safe to feel. Safe to speak. Safe to think. Just safe. I love that. I love an emotionally validating human. I love an active listener. I love reciprocity.
Anything you lose by speaking your truth isn't a loss. It's an alignment.
I found someone that I really cared for, then with time, they became my soulmate.
If I had to heal from you, I'm not letting you back in my space.
I leave my read receipt on so they can see exactly what time I didn't give a f*ck.
The night before a day off is more satisfying than the actual day off.
My ex used to put me on seen or block me when he doesn't want to be disturbed. Now, even when I tell my boyfriend that he can focus on work, he would tell me "doing that as we speak babe" while talking to me. The right person will always make time and will never be too busy for you.
Apply for that job. Date that person. Buy that plane ticket. Move to that city. Do all the things that scare you, because they're worth it.
It's a beautiful day to stop dwelling on things you can't control.
Don't let things be one-sided. It's not healthy, and it's not fair to you.
"I don't like how it makes me feel” is a legitimate reason to separate yourself from people, places, and things.
If you don't separate yourself from distractions, your distractions will separate you from your goals and the life you want.
Dying of laughter together is my favorite non-s*xual act of intimacy.
Sometimes you just need that one friend to rant to, and suddenly you are okay.
You really have to put yourself on a certain pedestal. Like yes, you're better than that, you're bigger than that, you can't associate yourself with that, you can't even entertain that.
Having a best friend that never gives up on you is a blessing.
If We Date: If you need me, call me. I don't care if I'm sleeping, having my own problems, angry with you. I'll be there for you.
Do you ever look at someone and just pray to God you never have to lose them.
Stick with the people who saw your potential while everyone else counted you out.
A relationship should be your happy place, not where you beg your partner to act right.
Knowing when to leave is so important. The job. The party. The relationship.
Who saved you when you were at your lowest?
You're not behind. It's not too late. You're exactly where you're supposed to be. Everything is unfolding. Don't judge yourself or be hard on yourself about how long something is taking to happen. Be patient. Your time is coming. Just be thankful that you made it this far.
I promise you, literally not a single friendship or relationship is worth damaging your mental health over.
I found love & friendship in one person.
Your nervous system will naturally feel calm around people with pure intentions and authentic energy - trust it.
Sometimes, I hate when I find shit out... I can't even pretend like I f*ck with you the same.
Maybe the next stage in your growth is being a little kinder to yourself.
You are so f*cking radiant! Own your shine!
Imagine meeting someone who has the same mindset and vibe as you.
Y'all don't realize how much communication can really change stuff... a simple “I'm busy all afternoon, I'm gonna call you tonight, and I'll text you when I can” instead of just not communicating goes a long way.
Somebody can treat you better in 3 months than someone did in 4 years.
I love you permanently, not temporarily.
Just a reminder that you're whole without someone else. You are not a fraction. You're a complete masterpiece all by yourself and you do not need anyone else to validate your existence.
Our generation thinks it's cool to not care. It's not. Effort is cool. Caring is cool. Staying loyal is cool. Try it out.
I'm honestly not mad at anyone for anything they ever did to me. You showed me you. I needed that.
Be the person who cares. Be the person who makes an effort, who loves without hesitation. Be the person who makes people feel seen. There is nothing stronger than someone who continues to stay soft in a world that hasn't always been kind to them.
Just a simple reminder to keep pushing forward, stay on track, and be positive. No matter what kind of rough spot you're in mentally, physically, emotionally, it's all temporary. Don't be hard on yourself.
You can forgive some people without welcoming them back into your life. Apology accepted, access denied.
Do you ever look at your best friend and think MY LIFE WOULD SUCK WITHOUT YOU I LOVE YOU SO MUCH THANKS FOR EXISTING because I do all the time.
The best people come unexpectedly.
Due to personal reasons I am no longer taking someone's inability to meet my needs as a reflection of my worth, but rather a reflection of their emotional capacity.
Not angry. Not mad. Not bitter. I just see things clearer now.
If you ever feel like I'm getting distant just know I learned my place with you.
Be in a relationship with the person who you can truly be yourself with.
I find it very manipulative that our angry side is always seen as our "true colors." As if when I'm happy and being kind, I'm being fake. All the good that we are and we're just reduced to our angry days or episodes?
What I'm grateful for: YOU.
A person who updates you because they know how you overthink while waiting for them is top tier green flag energy.
I was out with a bunch of people this weekend, and this guy suddenly went "man I miss my wife" and went home. Like... want that.
Your worst problems have an expiration date. Stay strong, keep going.
Don't f*ck over people who have been good to you. That's law.
Sometimes you have to accept the truth and stop wasting time on the wrong people.
Heal the root so the tree is stable.
You break your own heart by making somebody more important to you than you are to them. Never play yourself like that.
Stop breaking your own heart by trying to make a relationship work that clearly isn't meant to work.
You can't force someone to care about you.
You can't force someone to be loyal.
You can't force someone to be the person you need them to be.
Sometimes the person you want most is the person you're best without. You have to understand some things are meant to happen but just not meant to be.
Some things are meant to come into your life but not meant to stay. Don't lose yourself by trying to fix what's meant to stay broken.
You can't get the relationship you need from someone who's not ready to give it to you.
And you might not understand why now, but I promise you your future will always bring understanding of why things didn't work out.
Don't put your happiness on hold for someone who isn't holding onto you. Some chapters just have to close without closure. - Trent Shelton
If you're an overthinker, you need to read these.
You ARE loved. Someone out there loves you way more than you think.
Your anxiety will tell you the worst-case scenario. But understand this, it is lying to you.
You mean so much to your friends and family. They may not say it often enough, but they really do love and care for you.
You are so strong, and you can get through any, and everything. One step at a time.
It's okay to not to be okay. But just make sure you speak to someone and let go of any negative emotions.
You are not bothering anyone at all, they would love to hear more of your thoughts.
You have already survived so many things that you didn't think you would survive.
No matter what anyone tells you, you are incredible, amazing, intelligent, beautiful, you are enough, and you do matter.
I hope you win the battle that no one knows about.
Bad communication really ends a lot of good things.
Real friends will check your ego. Challenge your comfort zone. Celebrate your success. Don’t push them away, they push you to grow.
Imagine we flirt and end up lasting forever.
Be yourself. People don't have to like you, and you don't have to care.
I need like 10 incomes for this lifestyle I got in my head.
I miss you.
People don't always say "I love you." Sometimes it sounds like: Be safe. Did you eat? Call me when you get home. I made you this.
it's okay to miss people and still not want them back in your life.
Find someone who isn't afraid to admit that they miss you, who knows you aren't perfect but treats you as if you are, whose biggest fear is losing you, who says “I love you” and means it with all of their heart, someone who believes leaving and giving up isn't an option.
The old me would have reached out by now. The new me never will.
Does anybody else have that friend that you're pretty sure is your soulmate but in a friend way?
This year has taught me not to postpone enjoyment. Any opportunity to enjoy, take it.
You were distant so I gave you distance.
Finding someone who gives you good laughs, best friend vibes, epic conversations, and unquestionable loyalty.
Maybe home is nothing but two arms holding you tight when you're at your worst.
My last relationship taught me one valuable thing, that I never want to feel like I’m begging for someone's love, ever.
"You look happier" is the best compliment you can receive.
My standards are high because I can provide what I require.
"Distance yourself from people who bring out the person you're trying to grow away from."
"My feelings are hurt, and I need time to process them so I can better communicate with you" is a perfectly valid response & I wish we used it more in moments of conflict.
Focus on who you're meant to be.
Sometimes people re-enter your life not because they genuinely miss you and want to add value, but because you don't miss them, and their ego wants confirmation that they still have access to you.
When you finally learn that a person's behavior has more to do with their own internal struggle than it ever did with you, you learn grace.
Save space for people who matter. When others show that they genuinely care and have your best interest at heart. Save room for them.
Do not chase anyone.
Leave what is not for you. If it is not for you, something better will come your way.
The most important one, love yourself.
Your intuition will warn you about people early on. You just have to listen enough to yourself and trust yourself.
Your choice in a life partner - and the parent of your children - are two of the most important decisions that can make or break your life. Choose wisely.
Our little conversations mean SOOO Much more to me than you think.
"Stop explaining yourself and telling people everything. You owe no one any explanation of what you do. Your life is yours, not theirs."
August-September is going to be nothing but blessings and miracles. I know it, and I am claiming it.
We talk a lot about cutting people off, but nobody talks about the grief that comes with having to stand firm on that decision knowing it's not what you wanted but what was necessary for your well-being.
Once I make peace w/ the fact that you're not meant to be in my life, it's a wrap for you.
I love people who understand that even if we don't talk, we're good.
Stop thinking you need a relationship to be happy. Sometimes all you need is just money, traveling, and new clothes.
You have to love yourself enough to not tolerate disrespect, disloyalty, and wishy-washy feelings. If a person doesn't value you, move on.
Having someone to talk to about anything is priceless.
I just wanna hug you until we both feel okay.
Real friendships don't need convo every day, just know if you need me, I got you.
nobody should know when u and your partner on bad terms except you and your partner.
You're the ocean, and they prefer puddles. Don't take it personally.
Forever grateful for the real ones in my life.
I finally hit my “it isn't even worth it" stage.
Sometimes I'm not angry, I'm just hurt. There's a difference between the two.
I do what I can for people because I wish I had somebody like me in my life.
The right person by your side will have you saving money, living better, making moves, and laughing constantly.
Stop putting so much effort into someone who can literally go all day without talking to you.
Spongebob: What if I break your trust someday? Patrick: Trusting you is my decision, proving me wrong is your choice. Favorite line.
Fall in love with someone who makes you question why you ever thought you would be better off alone.
My mama told me today, "When you're getting your shit together, it gets lonely. But choose growth over company" & I'll never forget that.
Such a disappointment when you defend someone thinking they are different and they turn out to be just what everyone said.
Be the reason why people believe in beautiful souls, kind hearts, and good energy. Never stop being a good person.
I'm the type of person who always feel bad after being rude to people even when they deserve it.
Do not correct a fool, or he will hate you. Correct a wise man and he will appreciate you.
Get around people who don't mind complimenting you. People who give you credit where it’s due. People who are proud of you. People who uphold you. People who really show you it’s you for them. No matter what.
The most attractive thing to me is effort. Someone who really wants to talk to me, wants to see me, wants to make me a part of their day.
It breaks my heart knowing there are so many beautiful souls out there questioning their worth because someone they loved made them feel unlovable.
Look at all the stuff you've managed to do WHILE you've been secretly scared out of your mind and depressed. That's how badass you are. Imagine what you're going to do now that you're getting more and more control over things.
Stay single until you don't have to constantly remind someone how to be better or how to treat you right.
People who make you smile through tough times are so important.
There is something so beautiful about having long-term friends that have witnessed multiple versions of you and loved you unconditionally through each version.
No more forcing friendships or relationships. Either it flows or it goes.
The way you treated them at the very beginning when you were trying to get them should be the way you always treat them, don't change.
Loyalty is insanely rare, so if you find it, keep it.
Be careful of who you're venting to because vents go into different rooms.
Lack of communication leaves too much room for the imagination.
You deserve to be loved. Not liked, not lusted after, not settled for, but loved.
It's actually so sweet when someone stays up late just to talk to you.
Never force, don't beg, and don't chase.
Growth is when you don't react to things you used to react to.
I miss my home... I mean, you.
You will never find peace in an environment that you aren't supposed to be in.
Literally, since I met you, all my thoughts have been about you.
I just saw a post that said: “Sometimes you have to make peace with the fact that you are the villain in someone else's story even if you thought you were doing the right thing. You don't get to tell them how to narrate their experience.”
Master your mind because a single thought can ruin your whole day.
I want you to know that I choose you. I'll choose you over and over, without a doubt, and in a heartbeat. I will always choose you.
You’re not selfish for wanting the same energy and love you give. Remember that.
I asked this guy who should be served dinner first: the husband or kids. And he said “don't matter to me because no one is eating until my wife sits down” and I just...
Value anyone who supports you with nothing to gain from it.
When you see me with everything I deserve, just know that I prayed, waited & worked my ass off for it.
You're mine, and only mine.
I tend to overlove, and overcare, that’s why I overthink.
You deserve someone who will do everything to keep YOU.
Dating to marry, that’s it, that’s the post.
Clear communication IS SOOO attractive.
I forgive a lot of things, but I do not forget the things that have been said and done.
I just want to see you achieve everything you've ever told me, even if I am not there.
That “ignoring each other” game can turn into a “never hearing from me again” game real fast.
First, know your WORTH. Second, CONTROL your emotions. Third, Never settle.
Do what's right for you. Start putting yourself and your own happiness first.

My friend Paul makes $50k/month
on YouTube without showing his

face or recording his own videos.

Follow him to learn how
it works.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_2.jpg =====
1. HARD WORK

Don't believe in luck, believe in
hard work. Stop trying to rush the
process or searching fora
shortcut. There is none.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_3.jpg =====
2. PATIENCE

If you are losing the patience, you
are losing the battle. First nothing
happens, then it happens slowly
and suddenly all at once. Most
people give up at stage one.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_4.jpg =====
3. SACRIFICE

If you don't sacrifice for what you
want, then what you want becomes
the sacrifice. Everything has its price.
The question is: Are you ready to pay
it for the life you desire?

Consistency is what transforms
average info excellence. Without
consistency, you will never achieve
greater success.

Motivation gets you going, but
discipline keeps you growing. There
will be days when you don't feel like
doing it. You have to push through
those days regardless of how you feel.


===== 2023-08-23_12-52-39_UTC_7.jpg =====
6. SELF - CONFIDENCE

Confidence is, I'll be fine if they don’t
like me. There will always be someone
judging you for who you are and what
you want from life.

1. Be careful with private
information

Meet one wrong person and it
could ruin your life. My mom

lost everything and we became
homeless because we trusted the
wrong people.

2. Don’t think your job
is “safe”

No matter what, you're still just

“an expense” to the company
you're working for. It'd take them
less than a few days to replace you.
Have control over your own life.

3. Be healthy and take
care of your body

Without a healthy body, you can’t
have a healthy brain. Take care of
your health and body, and treat it

Be an adult. Mend relationships that you
find valuable. Don't let pride destroy good
things. But also be an adult and don't let

people play you.

End of the day, if someone cares about
you, they care about how their actions
impact you and make you feel. That's
all you need to know about people if

I just saw a quote that said

People don't even date anymore.

end up ignoring each other.

I'll never regret someone that I had
an amazing time and experience

Thank you

Who shares everything with

communicating goes a longggg way

Take time out today to tag
somebody that you know is working
hard and tell them you're proud of

You don't owe anyone..

..an interaction

your time, energy or love

an explanation about how you live

..a response to their questions

..an apology when you arent sorry
..INsight into your private life
Clarification of your beliefs
..elaboration of your feelings

Letting people be wrong about you or a

I was toxic to some, I was a blessing
to others. Some I healed, others I hurt.
I'm willing to admit that I wasn't
always right.


===== 2023-08-26_15-00-01_UTC.jpg =====
Your partner coming to you about
something you've done wrong isn’t
a personal attack. It’s a healthy
sign they value the relationship and
want to make it work — it's a heads
up. You communicate, you fix it,
you stay. That's emotional maturity.
That's commitment. That's love.


===== 2023-08-26_15-32-11_UTC.jpg =====
Limiting people's access to you is a

If you're a giver, remember to

Stop being the one who always makes
efforts. Relax and let the ship sink.

You attract what you think. I swear,
once you establish yourself as
independent/business minded,
people like you will come your way out
of nowhere. And that’s just the
Universe reminding you that when you
see something beautiful in yourself,
others can see it & admire it as well.

Someone just said you don't know a person

Sometimes, you find the right

Sometimes, it’s the wrong

It's you, and it has always
been you.

When something isn't right for
you, your soul rejects it and tries
to warn you in many different
ways. Pay attention to how things
make you feel and what
emotions they bring up in you.
These are all messages. If
something is not right for you, let
it go.


===== 2023-08-28_23-13-04_UTC.jpg =====

A good connection can be ruined over
the simple fact you miscommunicated,
or chose to not communicate at all. A
good connection can be easily lost,
because you chose to ghost instead of

Switching your mindset from "I hope

this happen" is such a game changer.


===== 2023-08-30_06-11-55_UTC.jpg =====
You disrespect yourself everytime
you say yes when you want to say
no. You call it loyalty, love, or
friendship. Really you're just hoping
someone will see how amazing you
are and choose you. It shouldn't
work that way. Choose yourself.
That's how you teach them. By
choosing you.


===== 2023-08-30_06-49-46_UTC.jpg =====
Marriage isn't “I promise to love you
until I stop loving you." It's “I promise to
make a conscious decision to
continue to love you even when it's
hard because I'm aware no one is
perfect, but you are worth it.”

I believe true love meets you in your mess
& not your best. When someone sticks
around no matter how hard things get,
they really love you.


===== 2023-08-30_15-01-26_UTC.jpg =====
Consistency can show how much
someone really cares. It’s easier to
do a great job every once in awhile,
but to show up multiple times, and
in a short time frame with the

Remember this when seeking
relationships: You're looking for an
equal, not a project. You're looking
for someone who takes care of
themselves AND has the capacity to
take care of you too. Someone on
your level that you can respect &
vice versa. Don't fall in love with
potential.

Let people judge you. Let them
misunderstand you. Let them gossip
about you. What they think about
you isn't your problem. Their

ever doubt your worth.

You're so rare, SO people are

about that.

The purest form of love is a
consideration when someone
thinks about how things would
make you feel. Pays attention to
detail. Holds you in regard when
making decisions that could affect

how much they consider you.

YOUNG MILLIONAIRE RESCUES
A COLOMBIAN S*X WORKER & FUNDS

HER UNIVERSITY...

(LAST WEEK, SHE JUST GRADUATED)

In 2021, I was on vacation with a friend in Colombia
(S. America), and I saw a girl on the streets clearly
offering herself to men passing by.

It broke my heart. So I did something weird -

I asked her out to dinner [*Calm down - not what
you think >>]


===== 2023-10-04_23-50-16_UTC_3.jpg =====

' @richardyuzee

She turned me down. “If I have dinner with you
- I'll lose time when I can be making money.”

So I offered to not only pay for dinner, but ALSO
pay $50 USD for 1 hour of her time (ridiculous, but
creative).

After thinking about it - she said yes [it gets even
crazier >]


===== 2023-10-04_23-50-16_UTC_4.jpg =====

@richardyuzee

To be VERY clear: From the start I had ZERO
intention of having s*x with her.

It was pure ministry and servanthood - I was
looking to see if I can get her out of the tragedy
she couldn't even see she was in.

So we sat down, and I just bluntly asked: “Why
are you doing this to yourself?”

And she just broke down into tears. Told me her
father (sole bread-winner for family) died of
cancer a year before...

And money got so bad she had to drop out of
college to work odd jobs to get by.

But NONE of it was enough - and prostitution
was so much more profitable (so she did it literally
to save for school and send money back home).


===== 2023-10-04_23-50-16_UTC_6.jpg =====

@richardyuzee

I knew at that moment I had to do something.

So I made her a deal: “I will fund your remaining
2 years in school for you, under ONE condition.

You stop prostitution RIGHT NOW, go back home
AND church (she fell out of faith with Jesus)

You send me report cards monthly, and if I see any
Bs or hints of prostitution, I pull funding.

She agreed...

@richardyuzee

2 years later, she graduated, is employed, and
taking care of her family with a story that inspires
thousands in her hometown.

And NONE of this would've been possible if I
didn't have the financial ability to do this.

You can't pour into others if your cup is empty...
