come into your life

to show you all the wrong things
so you know what to avoid

after you get rid of them

sometimes

people are lessons

and they give you bad experiences
so you can tell right from wrong
and know when you don't belong

experiences

they break and make you

split you up into broken pieces
until you put it all back together
just like you always do

"You never stop loving. Once you love
someone honestly, truly, you will never
be able to un-love them. You only find
someone who will love you more. At
that time your old love will not feel so
strong, but it is a heart, it will never let
you forget something that ever made
you happy."

WE FALL IN LOVE WITH
3 PEOPLE IN OUR
LIFETIME

EACH ONE FOR A SPECIAL
REASON
(Swipe left)


===== 2022-11-20_17-34-06_UTC_2.jpg =====
First love:

This love often happens at a young
age. You eventually grow apart or call it
quits over silly things.

When you get older, you may look back

and think it wasn't love. But the truth is, it
was.

It was love for what you knew love to be.

Remember: there are different
depths of love.


===== 2022-11-20_17-34-06_UTC_3.jpg =====
Second love:

The hard one. You get hurt in this one.
This love teaches us lessons and makes
us stronger.

This love includes pain, lies,

betrayal, abuse, drama, and damage.
But this is the one where we grow.

We realize what we love about love and
what we don't love about love.

Now we all know the difference
between good and bad humans. Now
we have become closed, careful,
cautious, and considerate. We know
exactly what we want and don't
want.

Ss

®


===== 2022-11-20_17-34-06_UTC_4.jpg =====
Third love:

This one comes blindly. No warning.
It creeps on you silently. You don't go
looking for this love. It comes to you.

You can put up any wall you want, but it
will be broken down. Youll find yourself
caring about that person without trying.
They look nothing like your usual crush
types, but you get lost in their eyes daily.

You see beauty in their imperfections.
You hide nothing from them. You want
marriage and family with them.

You thank the universe for them.
You genuinely love them.

We fall in love with
3 people in our lifetime

i

Each one for a special reason

(swipe left)


===== 2022-12-29_16-55-14_UTC_2.jpg =====
First love:

This love often happens at a young age.
You eventually grow apart or call it quits
over silly things.

When you get older, you may look back

and think it wasn't love. But the truth is, it
was.

It was love for what you knew love to be.

Remember: there are different depths
of love.


===== 2022-12-29_16-55-14_UTC_3.jpg =====
Second love:

The hard one. You get hurt in this one.
This love teaches us lessons and makes
us stronger.

This love includes pain, lies,

betrayal, abuse, drama, and damage. But
this is the one where we grow.

We realize what we love about love and
what we don't love about love.

Now we all know the difference between
good and bad humans. Now we have
become closed, careful, cautious, and
considerate. We know exactly what we
want and don't want.


===== 2022-12-29_16-55-14_UTC_4.jpg =====
Third love:

This one comes blindly. No warning.
It creeps on you silently. You don't go
looking for this love. It comes to you.

You can put up any wall you want, but it will
be broken down. Youll find yourself caring
about that person without trying. They look
nothing like your usual crush types, but you
get lost in their eyes daily.

You see beauty in their imperfections.
You hide nothing from them. You want
marriage and family with them.

You thank the universe for them. You
genuinely love them.

WE FALL IN LOVE WITH
3 PEOPLE IN OUR
LIFETIME

EACH ONE FOR A SPECIAL
REASON
(Swipe left)


===== 2023-03-10_15-54-21_UTC_2.jpg =====
First love:

This love often happens at a young
age. You eventually grow apart or call it
quits over silly things.

When you get older, you may look back
and think it wasn't love. But the truth is, it
was.

It was love for what you knew love to be.

Remember: there are different
depths of love.


===== 2023-03-10_15-54-21_UTC_3.jpg =====
Second love:

The hard one. You get hurt in this one.
This love teaches us lessons and makes
us stronger.

This love includes pain, lies,

betrayal, abuse, drama, and damage.
But this is the one where we grow.

We realize what we love about love and
what we don't love about love.

Now we all know the difference
between good and bad humans. Now
we have become closed, careful,
cautious, and considerate. We know
exactly what we want and don't
want.



===== 2023-03-10_15-54-21_UTC_4.jpg =====
This one comes blindly. No warning.
It creeps on you silently. You don't go
looking for this love. It comes to you.

You can put up any wall you want, but it
will be broken down. Youll find yourself
caring about that person without trying.
They look nothing like your usual crush
types, but you get lost in their eyes daily.

You see beauty in their imperfections.
You hide nothing from them. You want
marriage and family with them.

You thank the universe for them.
You genuinely love them.
